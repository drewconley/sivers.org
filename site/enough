I love my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00154JDAI">Kindle</a> and <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A41146122">E71</a> but you won't hear me rave about them.  I don't want you to want them.
</p><p>
Companies spend a fortune begging you to want their stuff.  I won't add to that noise.
</p><p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail_therapy">Retail therapy</a> is the worst kind.

I'd like to get 100 parrots and teach them to say “<strong>It won't make you happy!</strong>” - then let them loose in shopping malls, big electronics stores, and car lots.
</p><p>
Then, when people are considering spending thousands of dollars on a giant TV, or going deeply in debt with a new car, a surprising squawk might shock them back to their senses.
</p><p>
The quickest way to double your income is to halve your expenses.  Any study of happiness will tell you it's best to actively appreciate what you've got.
</p><p>
I feel a responsibility with my PA system of <a href="http://sivers.org/blog">blog</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/sivers">Twitter</a>, and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Derek_Sivers/609761260">Facebook</a> to only put helpful thoughts into the world.
</p><p>
So, no product raves here.  You already have more than you need.

At a party given by a billionaire on Shelter Island, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut">Kurt Vonnegut</a> tells his friend, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Heller">Joseph Heller</a>, that their host, a hedge fund manager, had made more money in a single day than Heller had earned from his wildly popular novel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22">Catch-22</a> over its whole history.
</p><p>
Heller said, “Yes, but <strong>I have something he will never have: Enough.</strong>”
