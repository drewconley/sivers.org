If you're putting your fans to work, let them know they're on the “inside family” now.  That if you hit it big, THEY hit it big.
</p>
<p>
No need to make specific promises.  It's a feeling more than a contract.
</p>
<p>
Same with your casual fans and email list.  Make them part of an exclusive club.  Bring them inside.

Everybody wants to be able to say they hung out with ____(your name here)_____ when she was just playing little clubs in her hometown, and now look at her!
