When I would speak on panels at music conferences, I'd always find it funny how all of the panelists' opinions were completely tainted by their own self-interest.
</p><p>
Someone would always ask us, “<strong>What's the future of the music business?</strong>”
</p><p>
The guy whose company sells MP3s would say, “MP3s are the future. No DRM. Unencumbered. The public has spoken and they want MP3s.”
</p><p>
The guy whose company sells subscriptions would say, “Subscription services are the future. Anything, anytime, anywhere. No need to keep a huge music collection.”
</p><p>
The guy whose company sells CDs would say, “People still want something tangible they can hold in their hand. CDs are going to be around a long time.”
</p><p>
I would just say, “<a href="http://sivers.org/no-oracle">Nobody knows the future. Anyone who pretends to is full of shit and not to be trusted</a>.”  (Which would of course get a weird look from my fellow panelists, but oh well.)
</p><p>
I still get asked to talk about the future of the music industry, but I just can't. My answer to everything is, “<strong>I don't know.</strong>”
</p><p>
For the last 11 years, I spent most waking hours thinking about how to sell and distribute music.  <strong>I'm completely unobjective.  I don't have fresh eyes about it anymore.  I know my opinion is not to be trusted.</strong>
</p><p>
You'd be better off to ask a young music fan or musician, unencumbered by too much knowledge of the past.
</p><p>
I love <strong>musicians</strong>.  I love the <strong>creative process</strong>.  I love the <strong>art and craft of learning, writing and playing music</strong>.
</p><p>
But the “industry” around it?  Eh.  No interest.  Sorry.  I'm burnt-out on that subject.  I need to spend a couple years <strong>unlearning</strong> before I can think about it again.
