Imagine you're in the audience of a play.  Big theater.  Opera house.
</p>
<p>
Imagine there are one thousand actors on stage.
</p>
<p>
Which ones would stand out?  Which ones would you remember?
</p>
<p>
It's not always going to be the loudest or most hyperactive.
</p>
<p>
Maybe you'd be drawn into the misty-blue woman with the long black hair in the deep blue cape with half her face hidden, standing silently at the edge of the stage.
</p>
<p>
Now you, as a musician, are one of the actors on that overcrowded stage.
</p>
<p>
Would you stand out?  Would people remember you? <strong>Are you being a strong enough version of YOU, so that people who DO want who YOU are can find you in the crowd?</strong>
</p>
<p>
(P.S. The most memorable actor on stage might be the one that gets off the stage, walks up to your seat, and gives you a kiss.)
