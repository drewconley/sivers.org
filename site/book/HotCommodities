    <h2>my notes</h2>
    <p id="booknotes">
Almost every time I've made serious money, it's been by heading in the opposite direction of the crowd.<br>
<br>
I am the world's worst trader.  Over decades, I've learned that the best way for me to make money is to find something cheap that I like, take a position, and hold it for the long term.  I'm a lousy trader and I avoid short-term investments.<br>
<br>
Search for opportunities in one or two sectors, then focus on a specific commodity or two that intrigue you.  Say copper catches your eye, the overriding question is:<br>
<br>
#1 : Will the price go higher?<br>
This might require serious homework. CRB Commodity Yearbook. Brief summary of inventories and demands in recent years. But you need to look deeper than that.<br>
<br>
#2 : What to look for?  Supply and demand.<br>
<br>
Always better to invest in the commodity itself, not the companies around it.  Saves a lot of effort and reduces a lot of mistakes.  Also on average will get 300% the return over the companies!<br>
<br>
I would not advise anyone to buy a house in New York, Boston, or London.  Not only have those cities been subject to overpriced real estate for years, but their economies are much too dependent on financial services, a market sector that has not done well in previous commodity bull markets.<br>
<br>
If you want to speculate in real estate, buy a house at the lake in a farm state (Iowa or Nebraska), or in an oil and natural-gas area (Oklahoma) or a mining state (Montana or Colorado), where communities will benefit from the rising prices in metals, energy, and agricultural products.  If you had bought property several years ago in commodity-rich countries as Canada, New Zealand, Australia or Chile, you would have increased your equity severalfold.<br>
<br>
I don't like to sell something short, unless it's *unbelievably* expensive.  (And I mean unbelievably.  I've shorted plenty of things in my life that were expensive, only to see them get more expensive.)<br>
<br>
"Facts and Fantasies about Commodity Futures" - article by Yale School of Management's Center for International Finance - is a truly revolutionary document.  Gary Gorton and Geert Rouwenhorst.<br>
Since 1959, commodities futures have produced better annual returns than stocks and outperformed bonds even more.<br>
Commodities have had less risk than stocks and bonds, as well as better returns.<br>
During the 1970s, commodities futures outperformed stocks.<br>
During the 1980s, the exact opposite was true, showing the negative correlation between stocks and commodities.<br>
Commodity returns do better in inflationary times, while stocks and bonds perform poorly.<br>
