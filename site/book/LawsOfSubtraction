    <p id="booksummary">I'm biased. I'm in it. This is a subject I live. So I flipped through a little fast, thinking, “Yep. I know. Got it. Living it. Yep.”  But for those who need some minimalist inspiration, this has some great thoughts in it.</p>
    <h2>my notes</h2>
    <p id="booknotes">
Poet Fujiwara no Teika:<br>
“The poet who has begun a thought must be able to end it so masterfully that a rich space of suggestions unfolds in the imagination of his audience.”<br>
<br>
Work is fun and productive when we’re doing what we do best while those around us are doing what they do best.<br>
It’s not so much fun when we’re doing work that others are better at but aren’t doing because we’ve failed to design the work properly.<br>
<br>
If we are wise enough to contemplate our own experiences, we can figure out the square root - what’s at the core - so that we can be not only wise but also heroic in using wisdom to take the right action to make fundamental changes.<br>
<br>
Having just one bad apple in a small group can drag down performance by up to 40 percent.<br>
<br>
Smaller teams are more effective than larger teams because as group size grows, more attention is devoted to running the group and less to the task at hand.<br>
<br>
Vacation policy employed by Netflix, the streaming video and DVD-by-mail company based in Silicon Valley, is audaciously simple and simply audacious. Salaried employees can take as much time off as they’d like, whenever they want to take it. Nobody - not employees themselves, not managers - tracks vacation days. In other words, Netflix’s holiday policy is to have no policy at all.<br>
<br>
Since Netflix wasn’t tracking how many hours people were logging each work day, these employees wondered, why should it track how many holidays people were taking each work year?<br>
<br>
Rules and policies and regulations and stipulations are innovation killers. People do their best work when they’re unencumbered.<br>
<br>
Lao Tzu wrote:<br>
“A leader is best when people barely know he exists; when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.”<br>
<br>
Read John Maeda’s book [The Laws of Simplicity]. It’s short and appears not to have much information. It appears simple, but it’s an incredibly complex book.<br>
<br>
Subtract the obvious, add the meaningful.<br>
<br>
Subtraction can mean the difference between a highly persuasive presentation and a long, convoluted, and confusing one.<br>
In my own experience I’ve noticed that speakers who deliver presentations with fewer words carry themselves better.<br>
They have leadership presence. They’ve internalized the story and are confident about their message.<br>
People who fill their slides with words and bullet points are often unsure of the material and speak with less passion and conviction.<br>
