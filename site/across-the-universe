Just saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0445922/">Across the Universe</a> last night.
</p><p>
Surprisingly good!  Some brilliant arrangements of Beatles songs.  The actors did all their own vocals amazingly well, with the help of auto-tune in a way that only musicians will hear.
</p><p>
CD Baby artist <a href="http://cdbaby.com/cd/danafuchs">Dana Fuchs</a> stole the screen as Sadie, and there was a big scene with <a href="http://www.breadandpuppet.org/">Bread and Puppet</a>, who I know from my circus days.  <a href="http://www.rebelsoulmusic.com/">Martin Luther</a> from the San Francisco area did an amazing job of “While My Guitar Gently Weeps” and if that was him doing a Jeff Beck style instrumental guitar melody to “Day in the Life” then I'm even more impressed.
</p><p>
Best thing was the creative re-contexting of songs, like “I Want You (She's So Heavy)” as Uncle Sam and Statue of Liberty as the I and She.   A great reminder that <strong>context can change everything</strong>, another subject I should rant about some time.
</p><p>
Just don't expect it to be a movie, really.  It's really more of a <strong>2-hour music video</strong> with just a few bits of non-singing.  Very worth seeing for anyone who appreciates great vocals, and new arrangements and contexts for the well-known songs.
