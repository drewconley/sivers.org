<p>When the subject of <strong>rebellion</strong> comes up with friends, I often quote this great phrase from “<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/12/lonely-dissent.html">Lonely Dissent</a>” : </p>
<blockquote>
[<strong>Real rebellion</strong>] doesn't feel like going to school dressed in black.  It feels like <strong>going to school wearing a clown suit</strong>.
</blockquote>
<p>
Today <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1401-starting-in-2006-peter-schiff-goes-prescient">Jason</a> pointed to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I0QN-FYkpw">this YouTube video of Peter Schiff</a>, <strong>two years ago, predicting exactly what's happening in the U.S. economy right now</strong>.  (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I0QN-FYkpw">Click here to watch even part of this video</a> to really understand the point of today's post.)
</p>
<p>
Every other expert on the show is <strong>laughing out loud</strong> (literally), scoffing at him, saying that's the most ridiculous thing ever.  (Then watch those same experts make predictions about 2008 that could not have been more wrong.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>For all you musicians and entrepreneurs who are used to having people tell you your plan, band, or company will never work</strong>, let this be a great reminder of what real rebellion feels like, and how sweet it is when everyone else is wrong.  :-)
