    <title>Over-compensate to compensate</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/compensate</id>

    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;
	You have something you want to change: a thought process or habit you want to fix.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Let’s use the metaphor of a bunch of bricks on a seesaw.
	Right now all the bricks are stacked on one side.
	This is the way you have been.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/compensate-l.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To make a change, &lt;strong&gt;most people don’t do enough.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	If you do something small and sensible, it’s like moving one brick.
	You’re still unbalanced.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/compensate-l1.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You think you made the change, but it’s not accounting for:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	a lifetime of doing it the other way
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	your environment that made you that way
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	the pressure from friends to stay that way
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	and the undertow of old habits
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	So, &lt;strong&gt;to make a change, you have to be extreme&lt;/strong&gt;.
	Go all the way the other way.
	&lt;strong&gt;It will feel like over-compensating&lt;/strong&gt;, but you have to stack a huge pile of bricks on the other side.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/compensate-r.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This new you sounds extreme and exciting.
	You will think you’re going to be completely changed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	But actually the old stuff is still there.
	So really this is what you needed to do to balance, to compensate for that cultural baggage, self-identity, habit, and history.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/compensate-b.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once balanced, it will sink in, and become your new normal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/compensate-b2.jpg"&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/compensate-b3.jpg"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Example:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You have a tendency to blame others for your situation.
	We all do this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/compensate-l.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You realize this is hurting your life.
	You think, “I shouldn’t do that so much. I should take some responsibility.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	So you try to make some changes:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/compensate-l1.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nope.
	That’s not good enough.
	Still unbalanced.
&lt;strong&gt;
	You need to go to a further extreme, in a way that will feel like over-compensating.
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	You need to think, “Absolutely everything is my fault. All of it. It’s my fault the world is the way it is. It’s my fault the government isn’t exactly to my liking. It’s my responsibility to fix everything I don’t love. It’s my fault that others act the way they do towards me.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Sounds extreme, right?
	It will feel like this:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/compensate-r.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You try to think this new way.
	Sometimes you really can.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	But you still can’t help feeling that some things are not your fault.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/compensate-b.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That’s OK.
	Now you’re balanced.
	This sinks in and becomes your new normal way of thinking.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/compensate-b2.jpg"&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/compensate-b3.jpg"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;More examples:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The best and most effective changes I’ve made in my life seemed crazy at first, because they seemed to be over-compensating.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I’m going to be writing about more of them in the future, and I’ll keep them listed here:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;a href="/my-fault"&gt;Everything is my fault&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;a href="/below-average"&gt;I assume I’m below average&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;a href="/lw"&gt;I love being wrong&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;a href="/no2"&gt;Saying no to everything else&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;a href="/up2you"&gt;Nobody’s going to help you. Does that encourage you or discourage you?&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;a href="/more-than-one"&gt;Double-speed! Half-speed! Up an octave! Down an octave!&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>How to take a compliment</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/thx</id>
    <updated>2016-02-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	You would think this would be a basic life skill, but it seems almost nobody knows it, so please spread the word.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
	When someone gives you a compliment, what should you do?
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Do you say, “What? No! Not at all. That’s ridiculous.”
	Do you give details of why you disagree?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	That’s what most people do.
	They refuse it.
	They deny it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	But think of how &lt;strong&gt;inconsiderate&lt;/strong&gt; that is.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	It takes &lt;strong&gt;courage&lt;/strong&gt; to give you a compliment.
	It’s a little &lt;strong&gt;vulnerable&lt;/strong&gt; for someone to admit they like something about you, and then to go up to you and tell you so.
	So when they do, is that nice of you to &lt;strong&gt;argue&lt;/strong&gt; with them about it?
	How do you think that makes them feel in that moment?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	So, when someone gives you a compliment, what should you do?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
	Just say, “Thank you.”
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Nothing more.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	It feels strange, but it’s the right thing to do.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	It doesn’t mean you agree.
	You’re just thanking them for their vulnerable courage in that moment, for taking the trouble to tell you something nice.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Then sincerely return their interest.
	Ask their name, or something more about them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	This advice came from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livingston_Taylor"&gt;Livingston Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, and was originally aimed at musicians, since they often get compliments after a gig, and always actively disagree with these compliments.
	But everyone can use this simple life skill.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why I don’t want stuff</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/gifts</id>
    <updated>2016-02-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <published>2016-02-16T00:00:00+00:00</published>
    <link href="http://sivers.org/gifts"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	About once a month, someone asks for my mailing address because they want to send me something.
	They liked something I wrote, and want to send me a gift in return.
	I’m very thankful, but have to say no.
	Here’s why.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I live in a little pre-furnished apartment with no stuff, and I love it this way.
	I have no books, knicknacks, decorations, and really no personal items at all.
	Just some minimal clothing, my laptop, headphones, and not much else.
	All the kitchenware and furniture just came with the place, and will stay here when I leave.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I just moved into this place a few weeks ago.
	I’ve moved every year or two since I was 17.
	I do it because I can, and living this way makes me happy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Every year, I erase my computer’s hard drive and re-install my operating system from scratch.
	Every week, I erase my phone’s log of texts and calls.
	I just love that uncluttered feeling.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	So when I receive something in the mail, no matter how thoughtful it is, it kinda sucks because &lt;strong&gt;now I have to figure out how to get rid of it.&lt;/strong&gt;
	I feel really wasteful if I just throw it in the trash, so I have to figure out who to give it to.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Then I feel bad for whoever spent a bunch of money and time to get and send me something.
	&lt;strong&gt;I appreciate the thought&lt;/strong&gt;, but really a nice compliment by email is actually much more appreciated than some thing that shows up in the mail.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	My family and friends know this about me, so I haven’t received anything for Christmas or my birthday in almost 20 years.
	I’ve been living this way a long time.
	It makes me really happy when another Christmas or birthday has passed and I didn’t receive anything.
	It makes me feel understood.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I’m not saying anyone else should be this way.
	Back when I was a full-time musician, I had a whole recording studio full of stuff.
	But these days, everything I want to do is on my laptop.
	If I had a different hobby, I’d have a different situation.
	I’m in awe of my friends with a steady home and huge collections that make them happy.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	It’s not even a problem.
	I’m not complaining or bragging.
	I’m incredibly grateful that I even have to write this.
	But because it comes up often, I thought I should explain it here.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Should you learn programming? Yes.</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/prog</id>
    <updated>2016-02-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <published>2016-02-14T00:00:00+00:00</published>
    <link href="http://sivers.org/prog"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	When I was 14 years old, my guitar teacher told me something important:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
	“You need to learn to sing. Because if you don’t, you’re always going to be at the mercy of some asshole singer.”
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	His point was about self-reliance.
	If you ever have any ideas, whether for songs or apps, you need to have some basic skills to turn those ideas into reality.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	One of the most common things I hear from aspiring entrepreneurs is, &lt;strong&gt;“I have this idea for an app or site. But I’m not technical, so I need to find someone who can make it for me.”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I point them to my advice about &lt;a href="/how2hire"&gt;how to hire a programmer&lt;/a&gt;, but most programmers are already busy and expensive.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Imagine if someone said, “I have this idea for a song.  But I’m not musical, so I need to find someone who will write, perform, and record it for me.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	You’d probably advise them to just learn enough guitar or piano so they can play their song.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
	It’s like learning to drive or make dinner.
	You only need to learn enough so you’re not helpless.
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	So, yes, you should learn some programming.
	Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are enough to start.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
	I recommend &lt;a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596159924.do"&gt;Head First HTML and CSS&lt;/a&gt; first, then &lt;a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920010906.do"&gt;Head First HTML5 Programming&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/strong&gt;
	Those are very fun, visual books where you need to see the detailed illustrations, so get the paper book or PDF.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	If you hate books, or prefer a course and community, use &lt;a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/"&gt;Free Code Camp&lt;/a&gt;.
	Ideally, do those books and this course at the same time, to really reinforce what you’re learning.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	You could go through those books or courses in a few weeks, and you’d already know as much as half of the people that call themselves web developers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	It’s a really amazing feeling.
	The mystery is lifted.
	You’ll look at all websites in a new way.
	You’ll understand what’s going on behind the scenes.
	You’ll know how to do it yourself.
	It’s really empowering.
	(It’s definitely been the most rewarding thing I’ve ever learned.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	For an inspiring example &lt;a href="http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/post/56319597560/im-learning-to-code-by-building-180-websites-in"&gt;see Jennifer Dewalt&lt;/a&gt;, who learned to code by building &lt;a href="http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/post/62998082815/after-180-websites-im-ready-to-start-the-rest-of"&gt;180 websites in 180 days&lt;/a&gt;, with no previous experience.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Next, &lt;a href="/learn-js"&gt;read my advice on learning JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to learn JavaScript</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/learn-js</id>
    <updated>2016-02-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <published>2016-02-14T00:00:00+00:00</published>
    <link href="http://sivers.org/learn-js"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	Since I’ve &lt;a href="/prog"&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; that I recently learned JavaScript, people have asked me how and what I recommend.
	So here’s my experience and best advice for 2016.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;
	Learn plain JavaScript
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	First, it’s important to &lt;strong&gt;learn plain JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Don’t depend on jQuery, CoffeeScript, or any other library of shortcuts.
	JavaScript will be around for many years, while libraries and frameworks come and go every year.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;
	How to begin
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Don’t just learn from little bits of tutorials, tips, or tricks online.
	Instead, you want a real foundation and solid understanding.
	Then all your future learning will be so much faster.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
	Start with the book:
“&lt;a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920010906.do"&gt;Head First HTML5 Programming&lt;/a&gt;”.
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	It’s a great introduction with a fun teaching style, which is important to get you familiar with something so new.
	Just read through it quickly in a couple days, before your deeper learning begins.
	(You must get the paper book or PDF, because the detailed pictures are necessary.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
	Do &lt;a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/"&gt;Free Code Camp&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Someone who had 600 JavaScript learners &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11048409"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Free Code Camp had the best results.
	Do it at the same time as you’re reading the books.
	Learning sticks better when coming through different senses.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;
	Now get deep
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
	Simultaneously begin the huge but awesome book:
“&lt;a href="http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/Professional-JavaScript-for-Web-Developers-3rd-Edition.productCd-1118222199.html"&gt;Professional JavaScript for Web Developers, 3rd Edition - by Nicholas Zakas&lt;/a&gt;”.
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	It’s the ultimate tutorial.
	It takes the time to explain everything thoroughly, and covers everything.
&lt;strong&gt;
	By the time you’re done with this one book, you’ll know as much as most people who call themselves JavaScript programmers.
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;
	Make it stick
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I highly recommend you &lt;strong&gt;write down every new thing you learn&lt;/strong&gt;, ideally into a flashcard program, &lt;a href="/srs"&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;.
	It’s a lot to digest, so you’ll have to remind yourself of what you’ve learned, or you’ll immediately forget.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;
	Reinforce it
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Afterwards, if you want to solidify what you’ve learned, quickly read through a few more books like these:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do"&gt;JavaScript: The Good Parts - by Douglas Crockford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596806149.do"&gt;JavaScript Cookbook - by Shelley Powers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://effectivejs.com/"&gt;Effective JavaScript - by David Herman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028857.do"&gt;Functional JavaScript - by Michael Fogus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;These books will go faster&lt;/strong&gt;, now that you’re fluent.
	Play around with the examples.
	There will be no huge surprises.
	You’re just enhancing what you know.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;
	Avoid the shortcuts
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	When solving a problem, everyone will point you to some pre-made solution.
	“Use jQuery! Use Backbone! Use this library and save yourself some typing!”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
	But no!
	Not yet!
	Do it the hard way.
	Solve everything yourself with plain JavaScript.
&lt;/strong&gt;
	It’s the best way to learn.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;
	What next?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	If you had a web app in mind, start building it now.
	(OK, you can use shortcuts.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	If you had an iPhone or Android app in mind, learn &lt;a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/"&gt;React Native&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	If you want a good-paying job, you can &lt;a href="/gethired"&gt;get hired&lt;/a&gt; almost anywhere.
	Since you know the real JavaScript foundations more than most people, you’re very valuable.
	You can quickly learn whatever framework they’re using.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;
	Any other suggestions?
	What worked for you?
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Please share any other suggestions or experiences, here:

    <title>Switch strategies</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/switch</id>
    <updated>2016-01-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <published>2016-01-27T00:00:00+00:00</published>
    <link href="http://sivers.org/switch"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	The directions to get you anywhere include a few turns.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	Go straight until you get to that intersection.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	Then turn left down the dead-end road.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	Cut through the park, past the fountain.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	Take the steps down the hill, and your destination is on the right.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The same is true in life, whether for business success or personal happiness.
&lt;strong&gt;
	You need to switch strategies a few times to get where you want to go.
&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	“Stay the course” is bad advice because if you don’t turn at one of those intersections, you’ll carry on forever in the wrong direction.
	And it takes a long time to turn around.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Early in your career, when you are searching for success, the best strategy is to &lt;strong&gt;say yes to everything.&lt;/strong&gt;
	Reach way outside your current circles.
	Do it all, and give it your all, no matter how small.
	The more things you try, and the more people you meet, the better.
	(They’re a little like lottery tickets.)
	You never know what random tiny connection could become your big break.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Then when you notice that one thing is extra-rewarding, it’s time to switch strategies.
	&lt;strong&gt;Double-down and focus&lt;/strong&gt; all of your considerable capacity on this one thing.
	Be a freak, and go above and beyond all expectations, to master this niche with everything you’ve got.
	Timing is crucial.
	Don’t be leisurely.
	Strike while it’s hot.
	You don’t get extreme results without extreme actions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	If by chance it was a dead-end road, then switch strategies back to the broad, with equal enthusiasm as before.
	How you do anything is how you do everything.
	You’re being tested.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Suddenly your focus on one thing will pay off.
	Because you’re successful, you’ll be overwhelmed with opportunities and offers in your field.
	Because they’re all so rewarding, you’ll want to do them all.
	But this is where you need to switch strategies again.
	&lt;strong&gt;This is where you learn to say “&lt;a href="/hellyeah"&gt;hell yeah or no&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/strong&gt;, to prevent drowning.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
	Now you admit you’ve arrived at your first destination.
&lt;/strong&gt;
	This is where you stop driving the same direction, and decide where you’re going next.
	Whether somewhere completely different, or just deeper down that path, the way to get there is to switch strategies again.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	P.S.  When you’ve arrived at your first destination, I highly recommend the great book “&lt;a href="/book/WhatGotYouThere"&gt;What Got You Here Won’t Get You There&lt;/a&gt;”.

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	A month ago I announced &lt;a href="/nowff"&gt;the /now page movement&lt;/a&gt;, where many personal websites are adding a “/now” page to answer the question, “What are you focused on now?”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	At the time, only ten websites had a /now page.
	Now there are over 280.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	It’s incredible.
	People are saying it helps them prioritize and focus.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://gregalbritton.com/now"&gt;Greg Albritton&lt;/a&gt; emailed to say he made a list of everyone with a /now page.
	So I turned that into its own website: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://nownownow.com/"&gt;nownownow.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	It’s been a fun programming project.
	I’ve been doing it full-time for the past month.
	&lt;a href="https://github.com/50pop/nownownow.com"&gt;See the code&lt;/a&gt;, if interested.
	It’s all open source.
	(Thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/SaschaKrause"&gt;Sascha Krause&lt;/a&gt; in Berlin for contributing a better design.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Then Greg wanted to do feature profiles, so he came up with six questions that I asked everyone.
	Now if you click the (+) by any link on &lt;a href="http://nownownow.com/"&gt;nownownow.com&lt;/a&gt;, it will bring you to a page where you can get to know the person behind the site.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	It’s addicting and inspiring to browse these profiles, and visit their sites.
	There’s a Twitter account — &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NowNowNow"&gt;@NowNowNow&lt;/a&gt; — that tweets out a link to a new profile every hour.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	People have told me they are getting a good amount of traffic to their site from people browsing &lt;a href="http://nownownow.com/"&gt;nownownow.com&lt;/a&gt;, so…
&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2&gt;How to add yours?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;If you already have a website&lt;/strong&gt;, just add a new page.
	If you’re using WordPress, look for “Pages” on the left, and choose “Add New”.
	Give it a “permalink” of /now.
	(Sorry I can’t help with tech support.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Write something about what you’re doing now, and publish.
	&lt;strong&gt;Once it’s online, email me the link at &lt;a href="mailto:derek@sivers.org"&gt;derek@sivers.org&lt;/a&gt;, and I’ll add it to nownownow.com.&lt;/strong&gt;
	After it’s up, I’ll ask you the questions for a profile page.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;If you don’t have a website&lt;/strong&gt;, but have been meaning to get one, create a free one at &lt;a href="https://wordpress.com/"&gt;wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;.
	Before you announce it, I highly recommend getting your own domain name at &lt;a href="https://www.hover.com/"&gt;hover.com&lt;/a&gt;.
	Point your domain to your WordPress blog, and use that.
	(Again, sorry I can’t help with tech support, but this is very common stuff, so anyone else can.)
&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2&gt;What now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Someone asked me what my vision is for the /now page movement.
	But I’ve never had one.
	I just enjoy being of service.
	&lt;strong&gt;People tell me what they want, and if it’s something I can do, I do.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	So if you have a good idea for what this could use or could be, please leave a comment here, or email me at &lt;a href="mailto:derek@sivers.org"&gt;derek@sivers.org&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

	People often ask me what I’m doing now.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Each time I would type out a reply, describing where I’m at, what I’m focused on, and what I’m not.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	So earlier this year I added a &lt;a href="/now"&gt;/now&lt;/a&gt; page to my site:
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="/now"&gt;sivers.org/now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	A simple link.
	Easy to remember.
	Easy to type.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	It’s a nice reminder for myself, when I’m feeling unfocused.
	A public declaration of priorities.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	(If I’m doing something that’s not on my list, is it something I want to add, or something I want to stop?)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	It helps me &lt;a href="/no2"&gt;say no&lt;/a&gt;, too.
	When I decline invitations, I point them to that page to let them know it’s not personal.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Anyway, &lt;strong&gt;today&lt;/strong&gt; the brilliant Gregory Brown announced that &lt;strong&gt;he added &lt;a href="http://practicingdeveloper.com/now/"&gt;a /now page&lt;/a&gt; to his site!&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I re-tweeted his announcement, and &lt;strong&gt;within hours, 8 more people made a /now page!&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://mikevial.com/now/"&gt;mikevial.com/now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theubergeekgirl.com/now/"&gt;theubergeekgirl.com/now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://blitzprog.org/now"&gt;blitzprog.org/now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.notkindacool.com/now/"&gt;notkindacool.com/now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.marclittlemore.com/now/"&gt;marclittlemore.com/now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://marcjenkins.co.uk/now/"&gt;marcjenkins.co.uk/now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://garrickvanburen.com/now/"&gt;garrickvanburen.com/now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I love it!
	I wish &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; had one!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;If you make a /now page on your site, please add the URL in the body of a comment, below.&lt;/strong&gt;
	Use the full http:// URL, so it will be a clickable link.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Update: all /now pages listed at &lt;a href="http://nownownow.com/"&gt;nownownow.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	(You do get what’s going on here, don’t you?
	Gregory Brown has &lt;a href="/ff"&gt;started a movement&lt;/a&gt;!)

    <title>Relax for the same result</title>

	A few years ago, I lived in Santa Monica, California, right on the beach.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	There’s a great bike path that goes along the ocean for 7½ miles.
	So, 15 miles round trip.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	On weekday afternoons, it’s almost empty.
	It’s perfect for going full-speed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	So a few times a week, I’d get on &lt;a href="http://surlybikes.com/bikes/pacer"&gt;my bike&lt;/a&gt; and go as fast as I could for the 15 mile loop.
	I mean really full-on, 100%, head-down, red-faced, sprinting.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I’d finish exhausted, and look at the time.
	&lt;strong&gt;43 minutes.&lt;/strong&gt;
	Every time.
	Maybe a minute more on a really windy day.
	But basically always 43 minutes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	After a few months, I noticed I was getting less enthusiastic about this bike ride.
	I think had mentally linked it with being completely exhausted.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	So one day I decided &lt;strong&gt;I would do the same ride, but just chill&lt;/strong&gt;.
	Take it easy, nice and slow.
	OK not &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt;-slow, but dialing it back to about 50% of my usual effort.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	And ahhh....
	What a fun ride.
	I was relaxed, and smiling, and looking around.
	Not red-faced.
	I was barely giving it any effort.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I saw two dolphins in the water.
	A pelican flew right over me in Marina del Ray.
	When I looked up to say “wow!”, he shit in my mouth.
	I can still remember that taste of digested shellfish.
	I had to laugh at the novelty of it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I’m usually so damn driven, always doing everything as intensely as I can.
	It was so nice to take it easy for once.
	I felt I could do this forever, without any exhaustion.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	When I finished, I looked at the time.
	&lt;strong&gt;45 minutes.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	What?!? How could that be?
	Yep. I double-checked.
	45 minutes, as compared to my usual 43.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	So apparently all of that exhausting, red-faced, full-on push-push-push I had been doing only gave me a &lt;strong&gt;4%&lt;/strong&gt; boost.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I could just take it easy, and get &lt;strong&gt;96% of the results&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	And what a difference in experience!
	To go the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; distance, in about the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; time, but one way leaves me exhausted, and the other way rejeuvenated.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	This was really profound for me, and I think of it often.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	When I notice I’m all stressed-out about something, or driving myself to exhaustion, I remember that bike ride, and try dialing back my effort by 50%.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	It’s been amazing how often everything gets done just as well and just as fast, with what &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like 50% of the effort.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Which, of course, makes me realize that much of my effort apparently wasn’t effort at all, but just ineffective stress added on top of something to make it &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like I’m doing the best I can.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Saying no to everything else</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://www.stevenpressfield.com/about/"&gt;Steven Pressfield&lt;/a&gt; had called himself an author for years, but he’d never actually finished a book.
	He just went through life feeling smug, feeling better than those regular schmucks, because he thought of himself as an author.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	But the psychological pain of not producing kept building until he couldn’t stand it anymore.
	He decided to finally beat that devil he calls “The Resistance”.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	He created a situation with no escape.
	Rented a cabin with only a typewriter, and shut off all other options.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	“I had a book in mind and I had decided I would finish it or kill myself.
	I could not run away again, or let people down again, or let myself down again.
	This was it, do or die.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	“I didn’t talk to anybody during [that year].
	I didn’t hang out.
	I had no TV, no radio, no music.
	No sex, no sports.
	I didn’t read the newspaper.
	I just worked.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	After an incredibly difficult year of wrestling with those inner demons and avoiding all temptations, he did it.
	He finished his first book.
	It wasn’t a success, but it didn’t matter.
	He had finally beat The Resistance.
	He went on to write many successful novels.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	He told this story in the great book “&lt;a href="/book/TurningPro"&gt;Turning Pro&lt;/a&gt;”, the third in his series of little books about the creative struggle, including “&lt;a href="/book/WarOfArt"&gt;The War of Art&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="/book/DoTheWork"&gt;Do the Work&lt;/a&gt;”.
	Read all three.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	When I read it in 2012, my own psychological pain of not producing had built up to an unbearable level.
	I had loudly announced &lt;a href="http://muckwork.com/"&gt;Muckwork&lt;/a&gt;, my brilliant new business idea, in 2008, but never finished making it.
	I had loudly announced &lt;a href="/song-contest-idea"&gt;Songtest&lt;/a&gt;, a free open song contest idea, in 2009, but never finished making it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I started many times, but each time decided to chase some other distraction that didn’t put my ass on the line, instead.
	There are always more emails to answer, always more things to learn, and always more people with enticing requests for me to help them achieve their dreams.
	(Each one swearing it’ll be just an hour of my time, tops.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	To make it worse, I was living in distracting Singapore, surrounded by so many interesting people.
	And with a short flight I could be in &lt;a href="http://www.tigerair.com/sg/en/real_deals.php"&gt;16 countries for under $200&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	So I decided to do my version of the Steven Pressfield cabin.
	I &lt;a href="/here"&gt;moved to New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;.
	I shut off all other options.
	Time to finish what I started.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Except for better or for worse, I still answer my email.
	I still get a hundred requests a week, but now it’s easier to say no to all of them, since &lt;a href="/local"&gt;I’m not local&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	It’s not the nicest mantra, saying “no”, “no”, “no” all day, but it is a reminder of why I’m here.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I’m posting this now because a few people have asked why &lt;a href="/now"&gt;I say no to all requests&lt;/a&gt;, so I hope this helps explain.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	But also this makes it a follow-up to my popular “&lt;a href="/hellyeah"&gt;Hell Yeah or No&lt;/a&gt;” post.
	There’s another level beyond that.
	It’s &lt;strong&gt;saying yes to one thing, and no to absolutely &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; else&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>“Just tell me what to do”: compressing knowledge into directives</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/2do</id>
    <updated>2015-08-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <published>2015-08-29T00:00:00+00:00</published>
    <link href="http://sivers.org/2do"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;h3&gt;
	Internalizing books
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Wanting to be successful, I’ve always read every book I thought could help.
	Even if a book had just one useful insight, it was worth the $20 and my time spent reading and thinking.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	A few years ago, I realized I was forgetting the lessons I’d learned from past books.
	So I started taking detailed notes while reading, saving every important idea.
	I wanted to permanently remember what I’d learned, and act on it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I saved these notes as text files and put them on my phone, so I could review them often.
	Now I also share them on my site at &lt;a href="/book"&gt;sivers.org/book&lt;/a&gt;.
	There are over 200 books there now, with my top recommendations at the top. Enjoy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	“Just tell me what to do.”
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When I’d tell my friends about a great book I’d just read, they didn’t want to read it.
	They didn’t want 300 pages of anecdotes, explanations, and supporting arguments.
	They’d say, “Just tell me what to do.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I realized that for some things, I also don’t want the full 20-hour explanation.
	I’d be happier with just the conclusions — the actions — the directives.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	For example, I’d heard great things about Michael Pollan’s book “&lt;a href="http://michaelpollan.com/books/the-omnivores-dilemma/"&gt;The Omnivore’s Dilemma&lt;/a&gt;”.
	But 450 pages about the history of food?  Eh...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Then two years later he wrote “&lt;a href="http://michaelpollan.com/books/in-defense-of-food/"&gt;In Defense of Food&lt;/a&gt;”.
	It sounded like a tighter argument at 250 pages, but... eh....
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Then he wrote “&lt;a href="http://michaelpollan.com/books/food-rules/"&gt;Food Rules&lt;/a&gt;”, a tiny little book that &lt;strong&gt;compresses all of his advice into 64 sentences&lt;/strong&gt;.
	&lt;a href="/hellyeah"&gt;Hell yeah!&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	It takes only 30 minutes to read, with succinct advice like “Eat only foods that will eventually rot.” and “Avoid food products that make health claims.”
	Each point has just a few sentences of explanation.
	That’s all I needed, because I already trust him.
	But you can reference his previous book if you want the supporting evidence behind the advice.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Compressing wisdom into directives — (“Do &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;.”) — is so valuable, but so rarely done.
	It feels arrogant and imperial to tell people what to do.
	Who am I to order people around?
	On the other hand, who am I &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to?
	It’s useful to people, so do it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I’m humble.
	I don’t expect anyone to actually do what I say.
	It’s just a succinct and powerful way to communicate an idea.
	Focus on the action.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	Compressing all this wisdom into directives
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So I spent the last few months going through all my notes for 220 books.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	First I extracted just the most essential and counterintuitive points.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Then the hardest part was turning observations into advice.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	For example, this observation —
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	“Behavioral psychologists Stephen M. Garcia and Avishalom Tor showed that merely knowing there are more competitors in a competition decreases our performance.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
	— turns into this advice:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	“Avoid awareness of competitors.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	But what about this observation?
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	“Half a group was shown that extraverts are more successful.  Other half shown that introverts are more successful.  Then when asked to recall events from their past to help determine which they were, they remembered just the events that support the successful group they were told.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
	How would you turn that into advice?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	The result?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I’ve now got hundreds of these wise directives.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I tried turning them into a 30-minute talk for a conference, but it was a disaster.
	Fun for the first three minutes, then overwhelming.
	A 30-minute TO-DO list that would take a lifetime to complete.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I would just list them all here, but I think that would be less useful.
	I like presenting &lt;a href="/1idea"&gt;one idea at a time&lt;/a&gt;.
	With just the directive and a short explanation, it’s a good blog format.

    <title>Simplify: move code into database functions</title>

&lt;p&gt;
If you are a web or API developer, programming code that uses an SQL database, this is for you.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I’ve found a very different and useful way to structure code.
It’s made such a big difference for me that I had to share it here.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
How things are
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Most web development — whether custom or using frameworks like Rails, Django, Laravel, Sinatra, Flask, and Symfony — tends to work the same way:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
At the core is a &lt;strong&gt;database&lt;/strong&gt;, which is just the storage of data.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;All intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; is in Ruby/Python/PHP/JavaScript classes.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
Why that’s bad
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These norms have some dangerous implications:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Everything&lt;/strong&gt; must go through these Ruby/Python/PHP/JavaScript classes — including shell scripts and other things not part of this website.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Nothing&lt;/strong&gt; else may access the database directly, since doing so may break the rules defined by these surrounding classes.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
The &lt;strong&gt;database is treated as dumb storage&lt;/strong&gt;, even though the database is smart enough to have most of this logic built-in.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
But if you add business rules into the database itself, it’s now &lt;strong&gt;duplicated&lt;/strong&gt;, requiring changing in multiple places if the rules change.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
These two systems — the database and its surrounding code — are &lt;strong&gt;coupled and dependent&lt;/strong&gt; on eachother.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
If it’s ever advantageous to &lt;strong&gt;switch languages&lt;/strong&gt; (say from Ruby to JavaScript, or Python to Elixir), you’re going to have to &lt;strong&gt;re-write absolutely everything&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
Simple vs complex
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Please go watch this amazing 35-minute talk as soon as possible:
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0"&gt;Simplicity Matters by Rich Hickey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Here are his important points for this article:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
“&lt;strong&gt;Complex&lt;/strong&gt;” is objective.
It means &lt;strong&gt;many things tied together&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
“&lt;strong&gt;Simple&lt;/strong&gt;” is objective.
It means &lt;strong&gt;one ingredient&lt;/strong&gt; — the opposite of complex.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
These are unrelated to “easy”.
It is easy to install and bind yourself to something very complex (like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping"&gt;ORM&lt;/a&gt;), and can be hard to build something simple.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
Classes, models, and methods (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming"&gt;OOP&lt;/a&gt;) are an &lt;strong&gt;unnecessary complication&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
Information is simple, so &lt;strong&gt;don’t hide it&lt;/strong&gt; behind a micro-language.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Work with values directly&lt;/strong&gt;: hash/map of strings.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
Since a &lt;strong&gt;JSON API&lt;/strong&gt; — a hash/map of strings — is often the eventual interface, it’s even more reason to skip the abstractions and work with values directly.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
Why this hit home for me
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’ve been using the same SQL database since 1997: same data, values, and SQL tables.
But the code around it has changed so many times.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In 1997, I started in Perl.
In 1998, I switched to PHP.
In 2004, a rewrite in Rails.
In 2007, &lt;a href="/rails2php"&gt;back&lt;/a&gt; to PHP.
In 2009, minimalist Ruby.
In 2012, client-side JavaScript.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Each time I’d have to re-write all of the logic around the database&lt;/strong&gt;:
how to add a new person into the database,
how to verify an invoice is correct,
how to mark an order as paid, etc.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But &lt;strong&gt;that whole time, my trusty PostgreSQL database stayed the same&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Since most of this is &lt;a href="http://rob.conery.io/2015/02/21/its-time-to-get-over-that-stored-procedure-aversion-you-have/"&gt;data logic, not business logic&lt;/a&gt;, it should be in the database.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So I'm putting this data logic directly into &lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org/about/"&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt;, since I plan to stay with it for many more years, but plan to keep experimenting with programming languages.
(TO-DO: &lt;a href="https://www.haskell.org/"&gt;Haskell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://elixir-lang.org/"&gt;Elixir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://racket-lang.org/"&gt;Racket&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.lua.org/about.html"&gt;Lua&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
How things could be
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Web developers have been treating the database as dumb storage, but it’s actually &lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/server-programming.html"&gt;quite smart&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It’s &lt;strong&gt;simple&lt;/strong&gt; to have all of this intelligence &lt;strong&gt;in the database itself&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It’s &lt;strong&gt;complex&lt;/strong&gt; to have it tied to surrounding outside code.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Once you put all of the intelligence directly into the database, then the outside code disappears!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then &lt;strong&gt;the database is self-contained, and not tied to anything&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Your outside interface can &lt;strong&gt;switch&lt;/strong&gt; to JavaScript, Haskell, Elixir or anything else with ease, because your core intelligence is all inside the database.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
How to do it
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
Table constraints
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The easiest place to start is &lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/ddl-constraints.html"&gt;constraints&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
CREATE TABLE people (
  id serial primary key,
  name text NOT NULL CONSTRAINT no_name CHECK (LENGTH(name) &gt; 0),
  email text UNIQUE CONSTRAINT valid_email CHECK (email ~ '\A\S+@\S+\.\S+\Z')
);
CREATE TABLE tags (
  person_id integer NOT NULL REFERENCES people(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  tag varchar(16) CONSTRAINT tag_format CHECK (statkey ~ '\A[a-z0-9._-]+\Z')
);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Define what is considered valid/invalid data here.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In my people example above, it says name can’t be empty, email must match that pattern with “@” and “.” and no whitespace.  Then it says tags.person_id has to exist in the people table, but if the person is deleted then delete the tags, too.  And the tag has to fit that regexp pattern of lowercase letters, numbers, dot, underscore, dash.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It helps to name your constraints for later use in error catching.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
Triggers
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For things that happen before or after you alter data, use &lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/trigger-definition.html"&gt;triggers&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
CREATE FUNCTION clean() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  NEW.name = btrim(regexp_replace(NEW.name, '\s+', ' ', 'g'));
  NEW.email = lower(regexp_replace(NEW.email, '\s', '', 'g'));
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
CREATE TRIGGER clean BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OF name, email ON people
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE clean();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This example cleans the input before it’s put into the database, in case someone accidently put a space in their email address, or a line-break in their name.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
Functions
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Make little re-usable functions for things you’ll use often inside your code.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
CREATE FUNCTION get_person(a_name text, a_email text) RETURNS SETOF people AS $$
BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM people WHERE email = a_email) THEN
    RETURN QUERY INSERT INTO people (name, email)
      VALUES (a_name, a_email) RETURNING people.*;
  ELSE
    RETURN QUERY SELECT * FROM people WHERE email = a_email;
  END IF;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That’s one I use often:
Given someone’s name and email, if they’re not already in my database, add them.
Then, either way, return the database info for this person.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
Views for JSON
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Instead of requiring outside code to convert your data into JSON, you can have the &lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-CREATION-TABLE"&gt;database create JSON directly&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For this, use &lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/sql-createview.html"&gt;views&lt;/a&gt; as JSON structure templates.
Inside the view, use &lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/functions-aggregate.html"&gt;json_agg&lt;/a&gt; for nested values.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
CREATE VIEW person_view AS
  SELECT *, (SELECT json_agg(t) AS tags FROM
    (SELECT tag FROM tags WHERE person_id=people.id) t)
  FROM people;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This will be used in the API functions, below:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
API functions
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These are the only functions your outside code will access.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
They return only JSON.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
CREATE FUNCTION update_password(p_id integer, nu_pass text, OUT js json) AS $$
BEGIN
  UPDATE people SET password=crypt(nu_pass, gen_salt('bf', 8)) WHERE id = p_id;
  js := row_to_json(r) FROM (SELECT * FROM person_view WHERE id = p_id) r;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE FUNCTION people_with_tag(a_tag text, OUT js json) AS $$
BEGIN
  js := json_agg(r) FROM
    (SELECT * FROM person_view WHERE id IN
      (SELECT person_id FROM tags WHERE tag = a_tag)) r;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No matter what you need to do with your database, the &lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/xplang.html"&gt;procedural languages built-in to PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt; can do it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/plpgsql-overview.html"&gt;PL/pgSQL&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;not the most beautiful language&lt;/strong&gt;, but the &lt;strong&gt;simplicity&lt;/strong&gt; of having everything in the database is worth it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you like JavaScript, check out the promising &lt;a href="https://github.com/plv8/plv8/blob/master/README.md"&gt;plv8&lt;/a&gt;, with a good &lt;a href="http://plv8-talk.herokuapp.com/"&gt;presentation about it, here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
Now, if you need a REST API:
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
require 'pg'
require 'sinatra'
DB = PG::Connection.new(dbconfig)

def qry(sql, params=[])
  @res = DB.exec_params('SELECT js FROM ' + sql, params)
end

after do
  content_type 'application/json'
  body @res[0]['js']
end

get '/people' do
  qry('get_people()')
end

get %r{/people/([0-9]+)} do |id|
  qry('get_person($1)', [id])
end

put %r{/people/([0-9]+)} do |id|
  qry('update_password($1, $2)', [id, params[:password]])
end

get '/people/tagged' do
  qry('people_with_tag($1)', [params[:tag]])
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
Or if you need a client library:
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
require 'pg'
require 'json'
DB = PG::Connection.new(dbconfig)

def js(func, params=[])
  res = DB.exec_params('SELECT js FROM ' + func, params)
  JSON.parse(res[0]['js'])
end

def people
  js('get_people()')
end

def person(id)
  js('get_person($1)', [id])
end

def update_password(id, newpass)
  js('update_password($1, $2)', [id, newpass])
end

def people_tagged(tag)
  js('people_with_tag($1)', [tag])
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
That’s it!
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now whether a REST API or client library, &lt;strong&gt;all it really has to do is pass the arguments into the database functions, and return the JSON&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I simplified the tiny code examples here, but feel free to see &lt;strong&gt;some real working examples:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/50pop/db-api/blob/master/peeps/tables.sql"&gt;table definitions&lt;/a&gt; with constraints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/50pop/db-api/blob/master/peeps/triggers.sql"&gt;triggers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/50pop/db-api/blob/master/woodegg/views.sql"&gt;views&lt;/a&gt; for JSON creation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/50pop/db-api/blob/master/peeps/functions.sql"&gt;functions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/50pop/db-api/blob/master/HTTP/woodegg.rb?ts=2"&gt;REST API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my little &lt;a href="https://github.com/sivers/pg"&gt;PostgreSQL experiments&lt;/a&gt; where I try out ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m not trying to convince everyone to do things this way.
But I hope you find it useful or at least interesting to consider.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Getting out of a bad place</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/bad</id>
    <updated>2015-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <published>2015-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</published>
    <link href="http://sivers.org/bad"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;
	This was actually a private email to a good friend.
	But he loved it and forwarded it to some people, and they all suggested I should post it on my site.
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A few months ago I was in a really bad place.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Really upset ALL the time about the whole situation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Couldn’t think straight.
	Very reactionary.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Wanting to make some big drastic change, just to ease the discomfort of uncertainty&lt;/strong&gt; — that pain of living with an unknown future.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	You’re definitely in that place now.
	So &lt;strong&gt;here’s how I got out.&lt;/strong&gt;
	Maybe it helps.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;
#1.
	Ask myself “What’s wrong RIGHT NOW?” — this very second.
	Am I in physical pain or danger?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	No.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I’ve got mental pain, but that’s just me &lt;strong&gt;imagining&lt;/strong&gt; things, or &lt;strong&gt;remembering&lt;/strong&gt; things.
	None of it is real.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	If I put aside the mental torture I’m giving myself, the only thing that’s real is this physical moment.
	Is it so bad?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Hm.
	No.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Look around.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Nice day.
	Nice place.
	Nice food.
	Nice people.
	Nice work.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Of course the mental anguish is still there, but it’s a nice reminder that it’s all in my head.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;
#2.
	Observe now. Act later.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	When I'm feeling so cloudy, my decisions and actions will be cloudy too.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	So I wait a few days before acting on anything.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Just &lt;strong&gt;watch the emotions pass by like a thunderstorm&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	And the longer I wait, the &lt;a href="/walkways"&gt;smarter I get&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;
#3.
	Raise standards.
	Say no to anything less than great.
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Every person that doesn’t &lt;strong&gt;rejeuvenate&lt;/strong&gt; me and make me feel better, say no.
	Blacklist them.
	Banned.
	Not allowed in, not even for a minute.
	No explanation needed.
	No compromise.
	No favors.
	Done.
	Gone.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	More fountains, less drains.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Every thing I’m doing that isn’t good for me.
	Every thing I’m eating or drinking that isn’t making me more healthy.
	Stop.
	Say no.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	This even means saying no to half-ass conversations that are not whole-hearted and unconflicted.
	People that are “fine” and I “kill time” with, but don’t actually love and actively enjoy?
	&lt;a href="/hellyeah"&gt;Nope.&lt;/a&gt;
	Not good enough.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Doing this gave me a huge feeling of self-worth.
&lt;strong&gt;
	Setting the bar really high for something to take my time.
&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	It means more empty time, but that leaves room for POSSIBILITY!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Empty time has the POTENTIAL to be filled with nourishing and awesome new actions and people, whereas filling it with half-ass things and people kills all that potential and possibility.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;
#4.
	Focus on my goal/mission/path
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The empty space created by #3 — no longer chasing distractions — helped me remember what I’m really doing with my life.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Creating, learning, improving, whatever.
	For me, it’s writing, parenting, and health.
	For you, it’s something else.
	It’s the 10-year-plan type stuff.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;
	Clearing the clutter helps you see the horizon.
&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	It’s a HUGE energy-filled feeling of “Oh yeah! That’s where I’m going! I had forgotten! I can see it now! Let’s go!”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	It really helps make the “say no” thing stick, because once you’re heading towards a spot on the horizon, you just don’t let any crap get in your way.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;
#5.
	Do ALL the daily mundane stuff
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	This sounds silly, simple, and shallow, but it’s surprisingly effective:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	When I’m upset, I don’t feel like doing anything but wallowing in it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	But despite feeling that way, I brush, floss, go to the gym, make healthy meals, take the kid out to play, do the dishes, clean the house, pick up clutter, vacuum, pay my bills, answer my emails, take my vitamins, do the laundry, play with the kid some more, brush and floss again, turn off the computer early, turn off the phone, and get to bed early.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	It’s so mundane, but it really helps to feel on top of things.
	Things in life well-sorted so I don’t need to worry about them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	(And when I ask, “What’s wrong right now?” — it really helps me say “nothing!” when I look around and see this clean house, paid bills, happy child, and have a good night’s sleep.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	It’s really peaceful to go through the motions, &lt;strong&gt;even though I don’t really feel like it&lt;/strong&gt;.
	It’s more time to think and process.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	It’s a great reminder that I have to eat, even if I’m not feeling hungry.
	I have to clean the house, even if my mind is a mess.
	I have to sleep, no matter what!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Like #1, above, &lt;strong&gt;it separates the mental anguish from the physical reality.&lt;/strong&gt;
	Keeps me focused on what’s real versus what I’m just imagining.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There’s more to it than that.
	Lots of diary time, friends, reading &lt;a href="/book"&gt;healthy new thoughts&lt;/a&gt;/philosophies, etc.
	But those are the big 5.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I hope it helps.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

    <title>How to change or build your career</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/career</id>
    <updated>2014-10-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
I get emails from many people wanting to change or build their career.  I always recommend the best book on the subject: “&lt;a href="/book/SoGood"&gt;So Good They Can’t Ignore You&lt;/a&gt;” by Cal Newport.  Here are a few of its best points:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Forget passion and purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Forget “follow your passion” or “find your true calling”.  Stop thinking like that.  Here’s why:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Words like “passion” and “purpose” are dangerous because they sound huge and romantic.
If you think you haven’t found your passion yet, you’re probably &lt;strong&gt;expecting it to be overwhelming&lt;/strong&gt; — to hit you like lightning.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Looking for your passion, purpose, or calling is an example of the &lt;a href="/mindset"&gt;fixed mindset&lt;/a&gt;.
You’re assuming that this is an inherent and unchanging thing inside of you, like trying to read your DNA or blood type.
But you won’t find passion and purpose there, because &lt;strong&gt;that’s not where those feelings come from.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Passion and purpose are &lt;strong&gt;emotions that come after expertise and experience.&lt;/strong&gt;
The way to get them is to commit to &lt;a href="/book/Mastery"&gt;the path of mastery&lt;/a&gt;, get great at something, and do great work.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So instead of looking for passion and purpose, just keep mastering whatever work you’ve started, becoming more and more valuable in your field.
Passion and purpose will follow a great career.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Great careers are only for the rare and valuable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Think of what makes a great career:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;good pay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;room to grow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;freedom and control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;positive impact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emotionally rewarding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Jobs like this are rare and valuable.
A great career isn’t something you &lt;strong&gt;find&lt;/strong&gt; - it’s something you &lt;strong&gt;earn&lt;/strong&gt; when you’ve got &lt;strong&gt;rare and valuable skills to offer in return.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In other words, you can only earn a great career by building your expertise and experience.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Solution: focus on the craft, not passion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The solution to this problem is what’s called “the craftman’s path” — the long-term path to mastery.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Everyone who became great at something has a similar story:
For years, they worked on their craft every day, even if they weren’t in the mood.
Always pushing, practicing, working, and improving.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It doesn’t matter if you’re feeling passionate about it that day or even that month.  You keep working and keep improving.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It doesn’t matter whether your work environment is ideal or you’re being wonderfully rewarded yet.  You keep working and keep improving.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Yes it takes thousands of hours of practice, but that’s good news!
&lt;strong&gt;It’s a clear path and it’s under your control&lt;/strong&gt;, instead of dwelling on unanswerable questions like “What is my true calling?”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You forget the self-centered concerns about your passion and purpose, and instead just keep improving and getting really damn good.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It doesn’t matter if your current job isn’t perfect.
&lt;strong&gt;You just keep improving&lt;/strong&gt;, no matter where you are, &lt;strong&gt;becoming more and more valuable&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
By building your skills, experience, and value, you earn a great career.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
By building your skills, experience, and value, &lt;strong&gt;passion and purpose come to you&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
By building your skills, experience, and value, you are building your “career capital”.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Career capital: use it to make a change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
“Career capital” is a metaphor.
Think of it like gold tokens you’re earning over years of building your expertise, experience, connections, and reputation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The important point is to &lt;strong&gt;remember how valuable it is&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When you want to make a change to your career, you spend this career capital you’ve earned.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But if you’re really sick of your current field and want to switch to another field, &lt;strong&gt;don’t just quit and throw away all the career capital you’ve built up!&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;If you’re thinking of quitting your job to follow your passion, please don’t miss this point!&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Think of ways you can &lt;strong&gt;use the value you’ve built up&lt;/strong&gt; to make the transition to another field.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="/tarzan"&gt;Like Tarzan&lt;/a&gt;, use your connections, reputation, experience, and expertise to &lt;strong&gt;transition&lt;/strong&gt; into a better situation in the new field before leaving the old one.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Realize the career capital you’ve built up already, and don’t just throw it away.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Starting from scratch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you’re starting from scratch anyway, jump into any growing field and start building your skills, expertise, connections, and reputation.  Pick a niche and dominate it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you have no ideas, check out &lt;a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/rfs/"&gt;this list of what startup investors want to invest in&lt;/a&gt;.
And &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=jwt+things+to+watch"&gt;JWT’s “Things to Watch”&lt;/a&gt; is always fun and inspiring.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Read “&lt;a href="/book/SoGood"&gt;So Good They Can’t Ignore You&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The ideas here are just a little incomplete intro to an amazing book.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“&lt;a href="/book/SoGood"&gt;So Good They Can’t Ignore You&lt;/a&gt;” by &lt;a href="http://calnewport.com/"&gt;Cal Newport&lt;/a&gt;, is the best I’ve ever read on the subject of building or changing your career.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I just searched my email out-box and found out that I’ve personally recommended it to people over 92 times in the past two years.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If this subject interests you at all, please &lt;a href="/book/SoGood"&gt;get and read the full book&lt;/a&gt;, not just my summary.

    <title>Fixed mindset vs Growth mindset</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/mindset</id>
    <updated>2014-09-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <published>2014-09-21T00:00:00+00:00</published>
    <link href="http://sivers.org/mindset"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
One of the most important concepts I’ve learned is the difference between the “fixed” mindset and the “growth” mindset.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It’s a little bit like “nature vs nurture”:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
People in a &lt;strong&gt;fixed&lt;/strong&gt; mindset believe you either are or aren’t good at something, based on your inherent nature, because it’s just who you are.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
People in a &lt;strong&gt;growth&lt;/strong&gt; mindset believe anyone can be good at anything, because your abilities are entirely due to your actions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This sounds simple, but it’s surprisingly deep.
&lt;strong&gt;The fixed mindset is the most common and the most harmful&lt;/strong&gt;, so it’s worth understanding and considering how it’s affecting you.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For example:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In a fixed mindset, you believe “She’s a natural born singer” or “I’m just no good at dancing.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In a growth mindset, you believe “Anyone can be good at anything. Skill comes only from practice.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The fixed mindset believes trouble is devastating.&lt;/strong&gt;
If you believe, “You’re either naturally great or will never be great,” then when you have any trouble, your mind thinks, “See? You’ll never be great at this. Give up now.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The growth mindset believes trouble is just important feedback in the learning process.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Can you see how this subtle difference in mindset can change everything?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More examples:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In a &lt;strong&gt;fixed&lt;/strong&gt; mindset, you want to hide your flaws so you’re not judged or labeled a failure.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In a &lt;strong&gt;growth&lt;/strong&gt; mindset, your flaws are just a TO-DO list of things to improve.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In a &lt;strong&gt;fixed&lt;/strong&gt; mindset, you stick with what you know to keep up your confidence.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In a &lt;strong&gt;growth&lt;/strong&gt; mindset, you keep up your confidence by always pushing into the unfamiliar, to make sure you’re always learning.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In a &lt;strong&gt;fixed&lt;/strong&gt; mindset, you look inside yourself to find your true passion and purpose, as if this is a hidden inherent thing.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In a &lt;strong&gt;growth&lt;/strong&gt; mindset, you commit to mastering valuable skills regardless of mood, knowing passion and purpose come from doing great work, which comes from expertise and experience.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In a &lt;strong&gt;fixed&lt;/strong&gt; mindset, failures define you.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In a &lt;strong&gt;growth&lt;/strong&gt; mindset, failures are temporary setbacks.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In a &lt;strong&gt;fixed&lt;/strong&gt; mindset, you believe if you’re romantically compatible with someone, you should share all of eachother’s views, and everything should just come naturally.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In a &lt;strong&gt;growth&lt;/strong&gt; mindset, you believe a lasting relationship comes from effort and working through inevitable differences.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In a &lt;strong&gt;fixed&lt;/strong&gt; mindset, it’s all about the outcome. If you fail, you think all effort was wasted.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In a &lt;strong&gt;growth&lt;/strong&gt; mindset, it’s all about the process, so the outcome hardly matters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And yes, the mindset itself is not fixed.  You can change your mindset just by thinking it through.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I’ve talked about this in &lt;a href="/ml"&gt;my “Meaning of Life” talk&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="/failure"&gt;my “Why You Need to Fail” talk&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re interested in checking those out, too.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But I get no credit for these insights.  This is all from &lt;a href="/book/Mindset"&gt;Carol Dweck’s book, “Mindset”&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="/book/ArtOfLearning"&gt;Josh Waitzkin’s book, “The Art of Learning”&lt;/a&gt;, both of which I highly recommend.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I love being wrong</title>

Most of the time I feel smart, successful, and driven - like I’ve got it all figured out.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But last month a bunch of stuff knocked me on my ass.  I’ve never felt so wrong.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I vulnerably called on friends for help.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.homesweetpdx.com/our-story/"&gt;Amber&lt;/a&gt; reminded me to pull my head out of today, and think &lt;a href="/time"&gt;long-term&lt;/a&gt; again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Marx"&gt;Jeff&lt;/a&gt; told me to get my swagger back and relish the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Hyatt"&gt;Ariel&lt;/a&gt; said I should really accept and feel this pain, instead of moving on so fast like I always do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Each different perspective made me feel good for a while, then I’d fall back into the whirlpool of destructive thoughts.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Whenever something’s wrong in my life, I’ve asked myself this amazing question:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;“What’s great about this?”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But now my only answer was, “Nothing. This just sucks.”  I tried asking it again every day or two, but the answer was the same.  Down the whirlpool I went.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
After moping at the bottom of the ocean for a few weeks, I got a bright memory from my former self.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;I actually love being wrong&lt;/strong&gt;, even though it cracks my confidence, &lt;strong&gt;because that’s the only time I learn.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;I actually love being lost&lt;/strong&gt;, even though it fuels fears, &lt;strong&gt;because that’s when I go somewhere unexpected.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="/book"&gt;I pursue these things&lt;/a&gt; in small digestable doses.  I love little lessons that surprise my expectations and &lt;a href="http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/the-fireplace-delusion"&gt;change my mind&lt;/a&gt;.  &amp;nbsp; &lt;em&gt;(This is why I aim to make &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/speakers/derek_sivers#talks"&gt;my TED talks&lt;/a&gt; surprising. If we’re not surprised, we’re not learning.)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But I finally answered “What’s great about this?”:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Getting knocked on my ass made me humble as hell.  It’s been years since I’d called for help.  It’s been years since my &lt;a href="http://thebuddhistblog.blogspot.com/2007/08/zen-story-cup-of-tea.html"&gt;cup was so empty&lt;/a&gt;.  It’s been years since I was so open to advice. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I smiled, thinking of how much I’ve learned from my friends these past few weeks.  I realized how ultimately happy it makes me to be so empty, even if it really hurts at first.  &lt;strong&gt;It’s better than thinking I’ve got it all figured out.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And with that, the sun came up and the whirlpool went away.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Thank you life.  Thank you friends.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The philosophy of great customer service</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/cs</id>
    <updated>2014-06-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <published>2014-06-29T00:00:00+00:00</published>
    <link href="http://sivers.org/cs"/>
    <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;
I was honestly surprised that my company, CD Baby, was such a runaway success.  But I was even more surprised to find out why.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
CD Baby had lots of powerful well-funded competitors, but after a few years they were all but gone, and &lt;strong&gt;we dominated our niche&lt;/strong&gt; of selling independent music.  150,000 musicians, 2 million music-buying customers, $139 million in revenue, $83 million paid directly to musicians.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What was the secret to CD Baby’s success?&lt;/strong&gt;  I never did any marketing.  Everyone came by word-of-mouth.  But why?  I honestly didn’t know.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So whenever I was out talking with my musician clients, &lt;strong&gt;I’d ask them&lt;/strong&gt;.  For years, I asked hundreds of clients why they chose CD Baby instead of the alternatives.  Or I’d just listen as they’d rave to others nearby about why they loved it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Was it the pricing?  The features?  Nope.  &lt;strong&gt;The #1 answer, by far,&lt;/strong&gt; almost every time someone raved about the company, was this:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;“You pick up the phone!  I can reach a real person.”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
They called and got a real person on the 2nd ring, instead of an automated call-routing system.  Or they emailed and got a surprisingly helpful personal reply, instead of an impersonal scripted FAQ response.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;And that was it.&lt;/strong&gt;  Who could have guessed?  That despite all efforts put into features, pricing, design, partnerships, and more, &lt;strong&gt;clients would choose one company over another mainly because they liked their customer service&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I structured the business to match this priority.  Out of 85 employees, 28 people were full-time customer service.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Since then, many entrepreneurs and interviewers have asked for my customer service tips and tricks, but I recently realized it’s not something you can add on top, it’s really a philosophy - a mindset that has to come from the core.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I’m no expert on the subject, but I’ve learned a few things from 16 years of experience, so here are the 6 key mindsets that I think guide great customer service:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;(Actually, I prefer the term &lt;strong&gt;“client care”&lt;/strong&gt;, since &lt;strong&gt;“client” implies a relationship, instead of “customer”, which is transactional.&lt;/strong&gt; But I'll use the normal term instead of confusing things by using mine.)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;#1: You can afford to be generous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The #1 most important mindset to start with, underlying everything, before engaging in communication with a customer or client, is that &lt;strong&gt;your business is secure&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Even if it’s not, you have to feel that it is.  Money is coming your way.  You are doing well.  You are one of the lucky ones.  Most are not so fortunate.  You can afford to be generous.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;All great service comes from this feeling of generosity and abundance.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Think of all the examples of great service you’ve encountered.  Free refills of coffee.  Letting you use the toilets even if you’re not a customer.  Extra milk and sugar if you need it.  A rep that spends a whole hour with you to help answer all your naive questions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Contrast it with all of the bad experiences you’ve had.  Not letting you use the toilets without making a purchase.  Charging an additional 50 cents for extra sauce.  Salespeople who don’t give you a minute of their time because you don’t look like big money yet. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;All bad service comes from a mindset of scarcity&lt;/strong&gt;, feeling like they’ll go out of business if they don’t fiercely guard their bottom line.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
They say the reason those in poverty so often stay in poverty is that short-term thinking of desperate survival doesn’t leave room to think of long-term solutions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you really feel secure, abundant, that you have plenty to share, then this feeling of generosity will flow down into all of your interactions with customers. Share. Be nice. Give refunds. Take a little loss. You can afford it. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Of course &lt;strong&gt;it’s also just smart business&lt;/strong&gt;. Losing 10 cents on extra sauce can mean winning the loyalty of a customer who will spend $1000 with you over the next 10 years, and tell 20 friends that you’re awesome.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;#2: The customer is more important than the company&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Think of a time where you had to make a big decision.  For example, the choice between a job that pays more money versus another that pays less but gives more freedom.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Do you remember how it felt when you were conflicted between these two choices?  Weighing pros and cons, going back and forth?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The way you resolved this was to finally &lt;strong&gt;decide which value was more important to you&lt;/strong&gt;.  For example: more money or more freedom.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Most of us don’t decide which value is most important to us until we’re forced to make this decision.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But if you want great customer service, you need to &lt;strong&gt;make this value choice up-front, and decide that your customer’s happiness is your top priority&lt;/strong&gt;, above company profitability, then make sure that everyone in the company knows this and acts upon it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You can’t micro-manage the details of every possible scenario, so make sure everyone in the company knows that whenever they have to make decision about what is the right thing to do, &lt;strong&gt;always do what’s best for the customer, what would make them the happiest, and don’t worry about the company&lt;/strong&gt;.  The customer is more important than the company.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;#3: Customer service is a profit center&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Companies put so much energy into sales - getting people to buy - but they don’t put as much effort into the customer experience &lt;strong&gt;after people buy&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Anyone can see the reason to focus on getting customers to buy.  It’s obvious profit.  But it takes some wisdom, experience, and long-term thinking to understand that &lt;strong&gt;keeping your existing customers thrilled is even more profitable&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Customer service is not an expense to be lessened.  It’s a core profit center&lt;/strong&gt;, like sales.  It’s something you &lt;strong&gt;put the best people on&lt;/strong&gt;, not the cheapest.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You’ve heard the old business truism that &lt;strong&gt;it’s 5 times harder to get a new client than it is to get repeat business from an existing client&lt;/strong&gt;, so this is where you put it into practice.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Hire the sweetest most charming people and make sure they have all the time in the world to spend with your clients, making sure they’re so heard, and so happy with your service, that they’ll tell everyone they know.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Hire enough people so that they have the time to pick up the phone, instead of routing people into an automated system.  If they’re so busy that their communications are getting too succinct, it’s time to hire another.  It’s worth it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;#4: Every interaction is your moment to shine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Probably only 1% of your customers or clients ever bother to make a customer service interaction.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So when they do, this is your time to shine.  &lt;strong&gt;Three minutes spent talking with them is going to shape their impression of your company more than your name, price, design, website, or features all combined&lt;/strong&gt;.  This is your shining moment to be the best you can be, to &lt;strong&gt;blow them away with how cool it was to contact you&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If your customer service is taught to be &lt;strong&gt;efficient&lt;/strong&gt;, it sends the message, “I don’t really want to talk with you. Let’s get this over with quick.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Since that’s what everyone else does, do the opposite.  &lt;strong&gt;Take a few inefficient minutes to get to know anyone who contacts you.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For example, at CD Baby, if someone would call, saying, “I’d like to talk with someone about selling my music through you,” we’d say, “Sure. I can help. What’s your name? Cool. Got a website? Can I see it? Is that you on the home page there? Very cool. Is that a real Les Paul? Awesome. Here, let me listen to a bit of the music. Nice, I like what you’re doing. Very syncopated. Great groove. Anyway... so... what would you like to know?”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I can tell you from my own experience of being a self-promoting musician for 15 years that it’s SO hard to get anyone to listen to your music.  So when someone takes even a couple minutes to listen to you, it’s so touching that you remember it for life.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This isn’t some sales technique, &lt;strong&gt;it’s just good human behavior&lt;/strong&gt;. It makes life better. It makes work more fun. It’s the right thing to do. And it pays off.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When people would call to buy music, we’d ask them where they heard of the artist, not in some monotonous scripted way, but as part of engaging the customer in a little conversation, sincerely interested in the details, maybe asking if they often discover new music that way, or whatever.  Then we’d include these details in the order on the backend, so the musician could see it, too.  It helped the musician be more connected to their fans, and helped both them and us understand why people were buying music.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Imagine what you’d do if Paul McCartney called&lt;/strong&gt;.  You’d drop everything, gush some praise, be thrilled that he’d contact you at all, and give him all the time in the world for whatever he wants.  So that’s how we should treat everyone that contacts us.  Why not?  You don’t have time?  Make time.  &lt;strong&gt;It’s how everyone deserves to be treated.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You know there’s research that says that we don’t smile because we’re happy.  We smile first, and the physical act of smiling makes us happy.  So I think the act of acting your best, being sincerely interested in others, taking the time to make each person happy, even if you weren’t in the mood at first, is a great way of actually being your best.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;#5: Lose every fight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Customer service often starts when someone has a problem, and is upset.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But kind of like you need to feel secure for your business to be generous, you need to feel secure enough to lose every fight.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Whenever they’re upset, let them know that they were right, and the company was wrong.  They win.  You lose.  And you’re prepared to &lt;strong&gt;do whatever it takes to make them happy again.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I’m saying this, but let’s admit that it’s so hard to turn off our human nature to feel things are directed at us - to lash back, and show them they’re wrong, to not lose this fight.  Occasionally, still, I start typing a response that’s not so nice, but after years of getting burned for doing that, I catch myself, and replace it with something angelic instead.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But you know that scene in the movies, where someone is saying something nasty or secret, and then realizes their microphone is on, so they immediately straighten up, correct themselves, and say the publicly-acceptable thing instead?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Well, &lt;strong&gt;your microphone is on&lt;/strong&gt;.  There is no private communication in customer service.  Anything you say is likely to be put onto someone’s blog or Facebook, retweeted, and seen by everyone.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So you must &lt;strong&gt;be the best version of yourself&lt;/strong&gt;.  You must let them win every fight.  You must humbly bow to your superior, and make them happy.  And kinda like I said about how smiling makes you happy, I think the act of doing this every day is very peaceful.  It feels like &lt;strong&gt;daily empathy practice&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Over the years, my company had some huge evangelists: people who loudly told everyone they met that they absolutely must use CD Baby to sell or buy their music.  Funny thing is, when I’d look back through that person’s history of communication, I’d often find out that the first time they contacted us, they were loudly upset about some problem.  I think the lesson learned is that &lt;strong&gt;loud people are loud people, whether complaining or praising&lt;/strong&gt;, so when you get some loud complaint, take it as an opportunity to do whatever it takes to make them so happy that they become a loud evangelist.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;#6: Rebelliously right the wrongs of the world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You know there’s this little passive-aggressive move we all do, when we don’t like how someone is behaving, we instinctively “take the high road” to show them how to behave?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Like if someone is talking too loudly in a quiet place, you speak extra-quiet to them.  If someone is being a complete slob, you clean up your zone before confronting them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It’s a kind of defiant act that says, “No. You’re doing it wrong. Here. Watch me. I’ll show you how it’s done.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Well, I think &lt;strong&gt;your business is your little part of the world where you can right all the wrongs of the world, and show them all how it’s done.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
To do this, you need to be rebellious.  &lt;strong&gt;Don’t follow norms&lt;/strong&gt;.  Don’t do what the other businesses are doing.  Instead, think of the worst you’ve experienced, and do the opposite.  Show them how wrong they were.  It’s very cathartic.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What do you think? Did I miss any important ones? I’d love to hear any suggestions.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Loving what I used to hate</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/hate</id>
    <updated>2014-05-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <published>2014-05-18T00:00:00+00:00</published>
    <link href="http://sivers.org/hate"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
From now on, when I say I hate something, remind me to add “&lt;strong&gt;… today&lt;/strong&gt;” to the sentence.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Here's why:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Tom Waits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first time I heard Tom Waits was &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEttHwPXARk"&gt;this performance on David Letterman&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I hated it.
I hated it passionately.
I complained to my friend that it was the worst thing I'd ever heard, and it must be some kind of joke.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The second time I heard Tom Waits was a year later, when my roommate played me “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0I4k9qqAjA"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt;”, and I hated it just as much.
I still thought it must be some kind of in-joke.
Maybe it's a dare, like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A1karl"&gt;hákarl&lt;/a&gt;?
Someone wouldn't actually listen to this for pleasure, would they?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The third time I heard Tom Waits was “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RASG2JmtDeQ"&gt;It's All Right With Me&lt;/a&gt;”, and &lt;strong&gt;suddenly I got it&lt;/strong&gt;.
Maybe it's &lt;a href="/mirror"&gt;because it's a cover&lt;/a&gt;, or maybe I was sick of all normal music that day, but his American exotic theatrical junkyard sound was just what I needed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then I bought the great &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Waits/Rain+Dogs"&gt;Rain Dogs&lt;/a&gt; album, and it's one of my favorite albums of all time.
(Especially “&lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Waits/Rain+Dogs/Tango+Till+They%27re+Sore"&gt;Tango Till They're Sore&lt;/a&gt;”, which I hated before, and now love the most.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Indonesia&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The best TEDx Conference I've ever been to was in &lt;a href="http://www.tedxjakarta.org/"&gt;Jakarta, Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
From the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdVLYMb8IGE"&gt;cross-gender dancer&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRVrm3svaUk"&gt;leader of games&lt;/a&gt;, I got such an &lt;strong&gt;overwhelming dose of Indonesian talent, culture, and pride that day&lt;/strong&gt;, that a part of me will forever feel Indonesian, or at least a big fan.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A week later, I had to laugh when I suddenly remembered that I used to hate Indonesia!  Why?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Because at my old company, CD Baby, whenever we'd get a big order from Indonesia, and ship the CDs across the world, the credit card company would contact me months later to tell me that order was placed with a stolen credit card.
Every time, it was Indonesia.
Small orders, big orders, every one of them was always credit card fraud.
I lost thousands of dollars before I finally had to block all Indonesian visitors to cdbaby.com, and silently delete any orders with an Indonesia shipping address.
I remember cursing that “nation of thieves” and its horrible inhabitants.
I'm sure at the time you couldn't have paid me to go to that awful place.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Oops.
Wrong.
Once I &lt;a href="/id14"&gt;got to know it&lt;/a&gt;, I loved it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Weight lifting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ever since high school, when I was solidly in the “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freaks_and_Geeks"&gt;freaks&lt;/a&gt;” category, I've made fun of people who spend a lot of time at the gym, lifting weights.
Stupid jocks, mindlessly lifting pieces of metal.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A few years ago, some people I know all recommended &lt;a href="http://www.mensjournal.com/magazine/print-view/everything-you-know-about-fitness-is-a-lie-20120504"&gt;old-fashioned barbell training&lt;/a&gt; as a great all-around fitness habit.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I tried it, and they were right.
I love it.
Three times a week, I'm in the gym (for only 30 minutes), doing squats and deadlifts, &lt;a href="http://startingstrength.com/index.php/site/about"&gt;as described here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I have to smile, thinking what my former self would say.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But the former self is not always right
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;We don't need to preserve our first opinions as if they are our pure, untarnished, true nature.&lt;/strong&gt;
They're often just ignorance or inexperience.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now when I catch myself saying that I hate (or love!) something, I try to remember to add “&lt;strong&gt;… today&lt;/strong&gt;” to the end of the sentence.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Opinions are likely to change at any time, but are much harder to change if you've carved out your self-identity, declaring “&lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is what I love! &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; is what I hate!”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Though I'm happy to say this is what I hate or love &lt;strong&gt;today&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Meaning of Life</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/ml</id>
    <updated>2014-05-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <published>2014-05-05T00:00:00+00:00</published>
    <link href="http://sivers.org/ml"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
	Let’s just figure out the meaning of life, once and for all, in under 20 minutes, OK?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	This is a 19-minute talk I’ve given at four conferences in Ireland, Taiwan, India, and New Zealand.
	I’ve improved it after each, and finally consider it done, so this is now the best and final recording of it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The video doesn’t add much, so if you would rather just listen, &lt;a href="/file/DerekSivers-MeaningOfLife.mp3"&gt;download the MP3&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The video should be visible below, but if not, &lt;a href="/file/DerekSivers-MeaningOfLife.mp4"&gt;download the MP4 video&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zzcCWEb-tyk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Huge thanks to some friends who suggested great improvements:
&lt;a href="http://www.michellewelsch.com/"&gt;Michelle Welsch&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://tynan.com/"&gt;Tynan&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://alytadros.com/"&gt;Aly Tadros&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Marx"&gt;Jeff Marx&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Also thanks to a hundred drunk programmers in Ireland who shouted and sang their way through my first performance of it, standing on chairs at the end of a Saturday night.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	If you would like to make a better video for this talk, please do.
	&lt;a href="/file/DerekSivers-MeaningOfLife.wav"&gt;Download the master WAV audio&lt;/a&gt;, and let me know when it’s done.
	Assuming I like it, I’ll be happy to link to it here.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Here’s the full transcript, if you hate surprises and my charming voice:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
	Transcript:
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There’s a true story about the student who showed up late to math class.
	He copied the problem that was already written on the board, assuming it was homework, and solved it that week.
	Only afterwards did he find out the teacher put it on the board as an example of an unsolvable problem.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	This question - “What is the meaning of life?” - is the classic unsolvable problem.
	For thousands of years, people have been trying to figure it out.
	It’s the punchline cliché of unanswerable questions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	But right now, let’s be the naive ones that don’t know it’s considered unsolvable, and just figure out the meaning of life in under 20 minutes.  OK?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	LIFE IS __________
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What word do you think goes in that blank?
	Life is what?
	Any ideas?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Let’s look at some of the different options that philosophers and smarties have said.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	LIFE IS TIME
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some say life is time.
	Life is all about time.
	The definition of life is the time between when you’re born and when you die.
	So the literal meaning of life is time.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	So if life is time, the way to have a good life is to use time wisely.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	How can you use time wisely?
	Five ways.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
	Remember it’s limited
&lt;p&gt;
	If you find out tonight that you’ve only got one year left to live, you’ll make the most of this next year.
	If you act like life is infinite, you won’t.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	To achieve great things, two things are needed: a plan, and not quite enough time.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Give yourself tight deadlines.
	Remember you could die at any time.
	Don’t delay.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	How can you use time wisely?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	Be mostly future-focused
&lt;p&gt;
	Make most of your current actions serve your future self.
	Learn, practice, exercise, delay gratification, save and invest your money, and build towards your ideal future.
	People who do this are more successful and even happier.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	But too much future focus leads to being a successful person on your 4th marriage, with no true friends.
	Too much future focus can take time away from important things that need you to be in the moment.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	How can you use time wisely?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	Be somewhat present-focused
&lt;p&gt;
	Sometimes, pull your head out of the future, and give your full attention to the present.
	Relationships, communication, and sex require this.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	But too much present focus is hedonism: living only for immediate gratification with as much excitement and novelty as possible.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Too much present focus leads to an empty bank account and no impulse control.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Too much present focus robs you of the deeper happiness of delayed gratification, achieving long-term goals, and developing valuable expertise.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	How can you use time wisely?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	Be somewhat past-focused
&lt;p&gt;
	To remember your past is to live twice.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Keep your life in the context of the past, to see how far you’ve come.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Put aside time to re-interpret your past events, as a powerful reminder that you can re-interpret your present and future, too.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	How can you use time wisely?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	Get in the zone
&lt;p&gt;
	You know the feeling of flow - where you’re focused on work that’s not too easy and not too hard - where the work itself has clear goals and is its own reward.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	People at the end of their life who claimed to be the happiest with their life were the ones who had spent the most time in this state of flow.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	For a good life, pursue the work that puts you in this state, and avoid the things that pull you from this state.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let’s say life is time.  What do you think?  Pretty good argument?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Let’s look at another perspective.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	LIFE IS CHOICE
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some say life is choice.
	Life is all about choice.
	You make a hundred little choices a day, and a hundred big choices in your life.
	These choices change your entire life.
	Your life is created by your choices.
	Therefore life IS choice.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	So if life is choice, the way to have a good life is to make good choices.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	How can you make good choices?  Four ways.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
	Let instinct trump logic
&lt;p&gt;
	The different parts of your brain started developing at different periods in evolution.
	The oldest part of your brain, the one that’s been evolving since we were fish, deals with instincts, fears, and gut feelings.
	The newest part of your brain, the one that’s pretty uniquely human, deals with logic, language, and predictions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	This newest part is still in beta.
	A $5 calculator can beat it at math.
	But this oldest part was launched a billion years ago, and has been in production and development ever since.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Everything you observe and learn is first processed by your logical brain, but then the results are permanently stored as instincts, fears, and gut feelings.
	Your instincts and emotions hold the culmination of everything you’ve ever observed and learned.
	So you’ll make better choices if you listen your instincts, instead of relying too much on your $5 calculator beta brain.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	How can you make good choices?  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	Stop at good enough
&lt;p&gt;
	You now have more options than ever.
	You try to choose the best option, the best career, the best school, and the best boyfriend/girlfriend/partner/spouse.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	But thinking this way makes you feel worse about the choices you’ve made.
	You’re more aware than ever of all the options you didn’t choose, and the benefits of each.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	So don’t seek the absolute best. Stop when you find an option that is good enough.
	You’ll make an equally good choice, but more importantly, you’ll feel much better about it.
	Happiness counts.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	How can you make good choices?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	Set limits
&lt;p&gt;
	Every choice you have to make causes a little bit of pain.
	Having choice in life is good, but having more choice is not always better.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	You’re happier when you let other people make some choices for you.
	If you’re very sick, you want your doctor to choose what’s best, not say, "There are dozens of good options. What do you want to do?"
	This is the appeal of religion.
	It gives you rules.
	It makes many of the choices for you.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	So set limits to your choices in life.
	Cut off some options.
	Give yourself rules.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	How can you make good choices?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	Choose important not urgent
&lt;p&gt;
	You know the difference between what’s long-term important versus short-term urgent.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	What’s urgent are emails, texts, tweets, calls, and news.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	What’s important is spending a thousand hours to learn a new skill that will really help you in your life or work.
	What’s important is giving your full undistracted attention to the important people in your life.
	What’s important is taking time to get exercise, or to collect and share what you’ve learned.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	But none of these things will ever be urgent.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	So you have to ignore the tempting cries of the urgent, and deliberately choose what you know is important.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So life is choice?
	What do you think?
	Pretty good argument?
	Let’s try another.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	LIFE IS MEMORY
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Some say life is memory.
	The future doesn’t exist.
	It’s something we imagine.
	The present is gone in a millisecond, so everything we experience in life is a memory.
	You could live a long life, but without a lot of memories, you only experienced a short life.
	If you don’t remember your life, it’s like it never happened.
	So life is memory.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	So if life is memory, the way to have a good life is to make more memories.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	How can you make memories?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Change routines.
	Break monotony.
	Move.
	Make a major change whenever you can.
	These are your chronological landmarks.
	These are the hooks where you’ll hang your memories.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Document it.
	Blog it.
	Not in a company’s walled garden, but in a format you can archive and look through in 50 years, or your grandkids can look through in 100 years.
	Keep a private blog for your future self, and tell the tales of where you’ve been, what you did, and the quirky people you’ve met along the way.
	You’ll be surprised how much you forget if you don’t record it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Socrates said the unexamined life is not worth living.
	What about the forgotten life?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	So life is memory?
	What do you think?
	Want to do another?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	LIFE IS LEARNING
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Both my smart friends and my spiritual friends insist that the meaning of life is learning - that the reason you’re here is to learn.
	Not just for your own sake, but for everyone alive, and future generations, the meaning of your life is to learn.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	So if life is learning, the way to have a good life is to learn a lot.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	How can you learn a lot?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Instead of talking about learning techniques, let’s talk about getting the right mindset, so you can learn more than you realize.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	You’ve probably heard about the Fixed mindset and the Growth mindset.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Fixed mindset says, "I am good at this" or "I am bad at this".
	This starts in childhood when your parents say, "You’re so good at math!"
	You think, "I’m good at math!"
	But then when you do poorly on one test, you think, "They were wrong.  I’m not good at math.”
	Most people think this way.
	You can hear it when they say, “She’s a great singer” or “I’m just no good at dancing.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Growth mindset says, "Anyone can be good at anything. Skill comes only from practice."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Two impossibly hard tests were given to hundreds of children.
	After the first test, all of the students were praised, but half of the students were privately told these 6 words: "You must be good at this."
	The other half were privately told these 6 words: "You must have worked really hard."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	When they were given the second test, the students who were told, "You must be good at this", did 20% worse on the 2nd test.
	Those 6 words encouraged a fixed mindset that made them feel there was no point in trying.
	You either are or you aren’t.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The students who were told "You must have worked really hard", did 30% better on the 2nd test.
	Those 6 words encouraged a growth mindset that made them feel that working harder made all the difference.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	So that’s a +-50% difference in performance because of 6 quick words by one teacher.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Multiply that by all the people in your life, all the days you hear feedback, and all the things you tell yourself, and you can see how this simple difference in mindset can make or break a life of learning.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Parents, pay attention to this.
	You may be harming your kids when you tell them they’re good at things.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Successful people, pay attention to this.
	You may be harming yourself if you believe the praise that people give you.
	People tell you you’re great at what you do, never just that you must have worked hard.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	So... life is learning?
	What do you think?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	Something else?
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
	Should we look at the Buddhist idea that life is SUFFERING?
	Nah, that’s no fun.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	Life is LOVE?
	Too ambiguous.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
	Life is NOTHING BUT REPLICATING DNA?
	Too accurate.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let’s change the subject.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	Chinese
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A few years ago, I started learning Chinese.
	I’m fascinated with the writing.
	I’m trying to memorize how to write these characters.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Chinese characters look complicated, but they’re mostly made up of smaller simpler characters, the way that English words are made up of Latin roots and such.
	So you can remember the meaning of each character by knowing the meaning of its ingredients.
	For example:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	语 language = words 讠+ five 五+ mouth 口
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	So... Language is words that at least five mouths speak? Brilliant!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	谢 thank you = words 讠+ body 身+ inch 寸
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Hmmm... This one is not so obvious.
	Maybe the idea is that when you say thanks, you speak words that give a body an inch of respectful space?
	That’s interesting.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	名 name = evening 夕 + mouth 口
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	So your real name is what’s spoken by a mouth in the evening?
	That’s kind of romantic.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I get so curious about the historical or cultural meaning behind each one.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Let’s change the subject.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	Talking Heads
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Talking Heads were a great band from the late-70s to mid-80s.
	Their lyrics were really evocative and mysterious.
	They made you wonder what they were really about. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Then I read an interview with the Talking Heads where they said that many of their lyrics were just random.
	They would write evocative phrases onto little pieces of paper, then throw them into a bowl, and shuffle them up.
	Then they’d pull them out, and put them into the song in that order.
	They did this because they liked how the listener creates meaning that wasn’t intended.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	We assume that if someone writes a song, then sings it on stage into a microphone, that it must have meaning to them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	But nope.
	It was just random.
	Any meaning you think it contains was put there by you, the listener, not the writer.
	Like a Rorschach test.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	Back to Chinese
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I got so curious about the historical meaning of these Chinese characters that I got a Chinese etymological dictionary that tells the full history behind every one.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	I looked up the examples I gave here, and found out those characters were just phonetic!
	Those composite character bits were NOT chosen for their meaning at all, just their sound!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	So it seems I’ve just been putting the meanings into them, myself.
	They actually had no meaning at all!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	It blew my mind.
	I had been memorizing hundreds of characters for months, reading all kinds of meaning into the ingredients of each one.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	After recovering from that, I thought:
	How many other things in life really have no meaning?
	What else have I been putting my own meaning into, thinking it was true?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	Wired
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I know that we’re wired to do it.
	I know we survived on the savannah for eons because we evolved to look for patterns.
	Our ancestors are the ones who noticed the patterns of the tiger stripes or the lion face in the grass.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;A moth is so deeply wired to fly towards the light that it may never accept that your light bulb is not the moon.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;We are so deeply wired to find patterns that we may never accept that many things are just random.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	We should have the same sympathy for our faulty wiring as we do for the moth.
	Evolution taught us to do this thing, but didn’t teach us to stop.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Give us some dots and a line, and we’ll see a face.
	Burn some toast and we’ll find Elvis in it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	A carrot from my garden looks like Jesus.
	What does it mean?
&lt;br&gt;
	A black cat crossed my path as I walked under a ladder on Friday the 13th.
	What does it mean?
&lt;br&gt;
	An old friend calls just a minute after I was thinking about them.
	What does it mean?
&lt;br&gt;
	What does it mean that you went to a prestigious well-known school? 
	What does it mean that you didn’t?
&lt;br&gt;
	What does it mean that your good friend died? 
	What does it mean that you’re tall?
&lt;br&gt;
	What does it mean that you have a lot of followers online?
	What does it mean that you don’t?
&lt;br&gt;
	What does it mean that you’re female?
	What does it mean that you’re male?
&lt;br&gt;
	What does it mean that you’re an entrepreneur?
	What does it mean that you’re not?
&lt;br&gt;
	What does it mean that all of your previous attempts at something have failed?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Nothing!  Nothing at all.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Nothing has inherent meaning.
	Everything is only what it is and that’s it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	So let’s get back to our original question and wrap this up.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;
	Life Is _____
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What is the meaning of life?  LIFE IS ______
&lt;br&gt;
	TIME?
&lt;br&gt;
	CHOICE?
&lt;br&gt;
	MEMORY?
&lt;br&gt;
	LEARNING?
&lt;br&gt;
	SUFFERING?
&lt;br&gt;
	LOVE?
&lt;br&gt;
	REPLICATING DNA?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	You can tell by the variety of answers that they are just projected meanings.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	You can choose to project one of these meanings onto your life, if it makes you feel good, or improves your current actions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	But you know the real answer is clear and obvious now.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Life is (just) life.
	It doesn’t &lt;strong&gt;mean&lt;/strong&gt; anything.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Erase any meaning you put into past events.
	Erase any meaning that’s holding you back.
	Erase those times where people said that this means that.
	None of it is real.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Life has no inherent meaning.
	Nothing has inherent meaning.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Life is a blank slate.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	You’re free to project any meaning that serves you.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	You’re free to do with it, anything you want.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Thank you.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Change careers like Tarzan</title>
    <id>http://sivers.org/tarzan</id>
    <updated>2014-03-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <published>2014-03-30T00:00:00+00:00</published>
    <link href="http://sivers.org/tarzan"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;
I get emails from many people who want to make a big change in their career.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Each one wants to quit their current career, and boldly leap into their new venture or preferred lifestyle.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When they ask my advice, they think I'm going to say, “Yes! Quit! Go for it!”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But instead, they're surprised at my suggestion:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Remember how Tarzan swings through the jungle?
He doesn't let go of the previous vine until the next vine is supporting his weight.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/tarzan-600x450.gif" width="600" height="450" alt="Tarzan swinging on vines"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So my advice is: Change careers like Tarzan.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Don't let go of the old one until the new one is supporting you.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And &lt;strong&gt;make sure you don't lose momentum&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;
P.S.  I highly recommend reading the book “&lt;a href="/book/SoGood"&gt;So Good They Can't Ignore You&lt;/a&gt;” for more thoughts on this.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
P.P.S.  Full credit for the “momentum” metaphor goes to &lt;a href="http://philippantar.com/"&gt;Philipp Antar&lt;/a&gt;, from the comments, below.
