A woman came up to me at a music biz conference, handed me her CD, and very proudly said, “This album cost $80,000 and two years to record. Everything is top-notch - we used one of the finest studios in the world.”
</p><p>
She wanted me to be impressed, but once she said “$80,000” I lost hope in her ability to make a living making music.
</p><p>
The music may be brilliant, but <strong>for a career to be sustainable, it has to be profitable.</strong>
</p><p>
I'd be much more impressed with someone who could make an album for $8000, because that would show <strong>sustainability</strong>.  They could record 10 albums for the price of hers!
</p><p>
I'd be most impressed with someone who could say, “This album cost nothing, and took two months to record, because I used my own home studio, and know how to make it sound great. My next 10 albums will also cost nothing.”
</p><p>
A big hit at the Cannes Film Festival last week was the movie “Colin”, <strong>made for only $70</strong>.  Director Marc Price used volunteer actors, used leftover makeup, and borrowed friends' equipment.  American and Japanese distributors are interested.  (<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/21/Colin/index.html">Read more about it, here</a>.)
</p><p>
There's a similar story behind <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Mariachi">El Mariachi</a>, made for only $7000, by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001675/">Robert Rodriguez</a>, who went on to do <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0227538/">Spy Kids</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401792/">Sin City</a>, and I'm sure has decades of innovative filmmaking left in him.
</p><p>
Both are admittedly low-budget, but prove the resourcefulness of the director, and their ability to make a great film despite any restraints.
</p><p>
If I was an investor, I'd invest in that kind of person.
</p><p>
<strong>Talent usually increases over time, but the ability to be resourceful usually decreases over time</strong>.
</p><p>
It's best for a career to start from a place of absolute resourcefulness.
