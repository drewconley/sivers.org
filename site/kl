I recently checked in with some old CD Baby clients and customers.
</p><p>
Many emailed back saying things like:
</p><ul>
<li>“I'm running a venue here in Boston that's always looking for good folk artists.”</li>
<li>“We have good-paying gigs 4 nights a week, but our singer is moving. Know someone good?”</li>
<li>“I have a radio show in Sydney, so if you want to send me some music...”</li>
</ul><p>
Unfortunately, all of this is just chaotically in my email inbox.  I have no way to <strong>organize these opportunities</strong>.  I can't keep it all in my head.
</p><p>
I've been planning on making <a href="http://karmalist.com/">KarmaList</a> an open database of music industry contacts.  (Programmers, <a href="http://50pop.com/karmalist">see the tech specs here</a>.)
</p><p>
But now I'm thinking I should also make it <strong>an organized list of who's looking for what</strong>.
</p><p>
I'd hire someone to go back through my email archive, and update the database with who's looking and who's offering.  Visit URLs and <strong>validate everything</strong>, then post it on KarmaList, if they say OK.
</p><p>
<em>(Maybe I'll make it invitation-only, so the website will just be verified high-quality listings?)</em>
</p><p>
<strong>I do all this for fun, not money, so it will always be completely free</strong>.  (No ads, either.)
</p><p>
But because I'm making this more for you than me, I might as well ask first:
</p><p>
<strong>Any wish-list for this kind of service?</strong>
</p>
