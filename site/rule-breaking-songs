<strong>How can you NOT be inspired to write a rule-breaking song after reading that?</strong>
</p><p>
I guess it's not as big of a deal to write a rule-breaking song, since a song can be written and recorded in mere hours for no money, whereas a movie involves hundreds of people and millions of dollars.
</p><p>
But that being said... <strong>what are your favorite rule-breaking songs?</strong>
</p><p>
Feel free to include a link to your own rule-breaking song, here, in comments.   :-)
