My first real job was as the librarian at <a href="http://www.warnerchappell.com/">Warner/Chappell Music</a>.
</p><p>
I loved it.  I was 20 years old, just graduated college, just moved to New York City.  I took it really seriously and learned a lot.
</p><p>
After 2½ years, though, I decided to quit to be a full-time musician.  (Partially because I was <em>too</em> happy there!  If I didn't force myself to quit, I was scared I'd never leave.  Too comfortable.)
</p><p>
<strong>Since I had never quit a job before, and didn't know how, I did what seemed to be the respectful and considerate thing to do:  find and train my replacement.</strong>
</p><p>
(It wasn't my boss's fault I wanted to quit, so why should I make it his problem?  If I want to quit, it's my problem.)
</p><p>
I called on my old friend <a href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Nikki-Alcazar/756291693">Nikki</a>, who I knew would be perfect, and offered her my job at my current salary.
</p><p>
She came with me to the office for a week while I trained her in every aspect of the job.
</p><p>
Once she had it mastered, I went into my boss's office on a Friday afternoon and said, “<strong>I need to quit now, but I've already trained my replacement.</strong>  She's great.  She'll take over for me starting Monday.”
</p><p>
My boss just looked a little stunned, then said, “Uh. Well. OK. We'll miss you. Tell her to see HR about the paperwork.”   And that was that.
</p>

<p>
10 years later, I'm running my own company, and for the first time, an employee tells me he needs to quit.
</p><p>
I said, “Drag. Well. OK. I wish you the best! Who's your replacement?”
</p><p>
He looked confused.
</p><p>
I said, “Have you found and trained a replacement yet?”
</p><p>
He looked a little stunned, then said, “No.... I think that's your job.”
</p><p>
Now I was stunned.  I asked a few friends, and found out he was right.  People can just quit a job without finding and training their replacement.  I had no idea.  All these years, I just assumed what I did was normal.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
There's a benefit to being naïve to the norms of the world.
</p><p>
Deciding from scratch what seems like the right thing to do, instead of just doing what others do.
