<strong>Let's think backwards for a while.</strong>
</p><p>
Start with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbkNxYaULBw">this brilliant <strong>reverse-reverse performance</strong> video</a>.  (Make sure to watch the whole thing.)
</p><p>
Only after you've seen that can you appreciate how much work Jeroen Offerman put into <strong><a href="http://www.adnstream.tv/video/mazNfoQliF/Jeroen-Offerman-Stairway-at-St-Pauls-reversed">Stairway at St. Paul's</a></strong>.
</p><p>
I love that <a href="http://sivers.org/fela">Fela Kuti never performed songs after he had recorded them</a>.  (<strong>Backwards record-release</strong>?)
</p><p>
Has anyone heard a truly <strong>backwards song structure</strong>?  (Chorus, Chorus, Bridge, Chorus, Verse, Chorus, Verse?)
</p><p>
Not backwards, but I always admired that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Queen">Dancing Queen</a> starts with the pre-chorus (“You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life...”).
</p><p>
The <strong>backwards romantic relationship</strong> is used sometimes in movies: start fighting immediately (hate eachother at first), then merely annoyed, then in love, then passionately physical, then notice things they like about eachother, then co-exist.  Another variation is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Button">Benjamin Button</a>, of course.
</p><p>
See the brilliant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_(film)">Memento</a>, where the <strong>story is told backwards</strong>, showing the ending first and the beginning last.  (If you've seen it once, see it again. It's even better the 2nd time.)
</p><p>
The dot-com era had plenty of <strong>backwards businesses</strong>: start by making a ton of money (IPO), (now have 500 employees), then build solid business infrastructure, then spend a lot of money marketing, then figure out what you really have to offer, (now only 100 employees), then try to make a profit, then brainstorm really good ideas, (now only 10 employees), then close the business, and the founders go work for someone else.
</p><p>
(Also there are <a href="http://sivers.org/reversible">reversible business models</a>, but that's mirror-image, not backwards.)
</p><p>
<strong>What else can go backwards?</strong>
