What super-power do you want?
</p><ul>
<li>Invisibility?</li>
<li>Flying?</li>
<li>Stop time?</li>
<li>Read minds?</li>
<li>Immortality?</li>
</ul><p>
Do you ever play this conversation-game?  Ask a group of friends this question.  It's interesting to hear different people's answers, and what they reveal.
</p><p>
When I was a kid, I wanted to <strong>fly</strong>.
</p><p>
When I was a teenager, I wanted to be <strong>invisible</strong>. (Probably to sneak into girl's rooms and watch them undress.)
</p><p>
For the last 20 years, I wanted to <strong>stop time</strong>. (So much work to do! Never enough time!)
</p><p>
But recently when this game came up with a friend, I realized that for the first time in 20 years, I didn't want to stop time.  I've changed.  My new super-power is I want to <strong>know everything</strong>.  (Speak every language. Know every fact. Understand the universe.)
</p><p>
A year from now, it may be a different answer.
</p><p>
Whenever I went to a book store in the last 10 years, I'd go to the <strong>business</strong> section (as <a href="http://sivers.org/book">you can see, here</a>.)  But this past year, I was more interested in the <strong>travel</strong> section (<a href="http://sivers.org/how-was-india">India</a>, <a href="http://sivers.org/asia-diary">Asia</a>, <a href="http://sivers.org/iceland">Iceland</a>, etc.)
</p><p>
A month ago I found myself wanting to take two years off to go visit 24 countries for one month each. I was quite seriously considering this! 
</p><p>
Last week, I found myself in a book store again with a friend.  She needed to go the the travel section, so I went with her, but found I had no interest anymore.  Something's shifted.  <strong>I want to work again.  Vacation is done.</strong>
</p><p>
Sometimes you don't notice these changes in yourself until a conversation-game or book store reveals it.
</p><p>
So, since we're here talking anyway, I'm asking you now: <strong>What super-power do you want?</strong>  Please leave a reply, below.
