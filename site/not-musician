<p>
When describing your music, PLEASE don't be a musician.
</p>
<p>
Don't say, “Wonderful harmonies and intricate arrangements. A tight rhythm section and introspective lyrics!”
</p>
<p>
Real people don't even understand what that means.  That's musician speak.
</p>
<p>
Think what an office-worker would say to a friend about your music: “It's cute! They have this song that has a little ”hoop-hoop!“ at the beginning, with that baby voice.  It's kinda funky!  And he's got this sexy bedroom voice.  Cool video.”
</p>
<p>
Think what one teenager down at the mall would say to another, when describing what they love about your CD: “Dude - it's like if Korn hadn't wimped out. It's like Busta Rhymes went metal, but they're from Mars or somethin. It's slammin. And you gotta see that picture on the inside cover!”
</p>
<p>
Real people often compare an artist to other famous artists.  Real people talk about the overall “vibe” or sound of something.
</p>
<p>
Real people DON'T talk about “insightful lyrics” and “wonderful harmonies” and “tight musicianship”.  That's musician-speak.
</p>
<p>
Play your music for some non-musicians, and ask them what they'd say to a friend about it.
</p>
<p>
Avoid musician-terms, and learn to <strong>describe your music in ways that reach normal people's emotion and imagination</strong>, and your music itself will be that much more likely to reach and touch people.
</p>
<p>
Your descriptions of your music should be almost as exciting (or touching, or sad, or shocking) as the music itself.
