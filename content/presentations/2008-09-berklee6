My old school - Berklee College of Music - asked me to speak to a packed auditorium of first-day students. I was thrilled. I had so much to say. I had thought about this a lot. I had been waiting 20 years to give this talk.<br>
<br>
The 6 things:<br>
#1 : Focus. Disconnect. Do not be distracted.<br>
#2 : Do not accept their speed limit.<br>
#3 : Nobody will teach you anything. You have to teach yourself.<br>
#4 : Learn from your heroes, not only theirs.<br>
#5 : Don't get stuck in the past.<br>
#6 : When done, be valuable.<br>
