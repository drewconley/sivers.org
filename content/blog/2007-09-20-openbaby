<!-- What it would be like to open up ALL aspects of CD Baby -->
<p>Had an interesting conversation with an ex about what makes you feel loved.</p>

<p>Turns out we had quite opposite definitions.</p>

<p>Mine was <strong>feeling transparent.  Holding nothing back.  Revealing everything, faults and all</strong>, and still feeling accepted.</p>

<p>Later, I was thinking about CD Baby and how fun it's been to open up and show our numbers. (See a history of this, below.)</p>

<p>Then I was thinking about collaboration, Wikipedia and all that.  How the collective intelligence of the world is always better than what you've got in-house.</p>

<p>Combine those two thoughts, and I'm <strong>imagining what it would be like to open up ALL aspects of CD Baby</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li> show not just our sales numbers, but ALL numbers, including expenses, salaries, income, taxes and everything else</li>
<li> (clients' and customers' info would be show only collectively not individually, for obvious privacy reasons)</li>
<li> if a paper supplier sees what we're paying for our mailers and knows they can beat it, they can contact us to let us know</li>
<li> show performance numbers, such as # of CDs shipped per-day, emails answered per-person, # of albums added each day</li>
<li> post audio of our company meetings on the site for all to hear</li>
<li> open all of our internal knowledge-base, form-letters, etc</li>
<li> encourage suggestions on how we could be running things better</li>
<li> open the PHP source code that runs the site</li>
<li> allow any webdesigners to make their own CSS skin for the site</li>
<li> encourage corrections to anything on the site. spelling fixes in artist bios, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>I like this for a few reasons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> keeps us on your toes by encouraging competition</li>
<li> reminds us that the real value here is in our relationships with the musicians.  anyone can take our PHP source code and make &quot;another CD Baby&quot;, but not anyone can win the trust and relationships we've built one at a time over the last 10 years.</li>
<li> makes us double-check our internal decisions against public scrutiny.   (we already always do this, but this would emphasize it even more)</li>
<li> shows everyone we've got nothing to hide.  that we really are trustable.  (hey - was there any doubt?)</li>
<li> gets others involved.  allow anyone to buy shares in the company, so they can have a vested interest in our success.</li>
<li> makes it easier to get our financials to our accountant (“just go to the site. it's all there.”)</li>
<li> it's contrarian.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What are the downsides?</strong><br />* big security risk if my PHP code has bugs that can be exploited to get customer/client data<br />* pain in the ass, having to hear the world's opinions on every internal thing every day.</p>

<p><strong>Any benefits or downsides I'm missing?</strong></p>
