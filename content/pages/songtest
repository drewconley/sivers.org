First, read “<a href="http://sivers.org/song-contest-idea">A free, open song contest idea</a>.”
</p><p>
The big idea is that this songwriting contest will mostly run itself, on a monthly loop.  A manager's role is only to contact companies to ask if they want to donate prizes for the winners, in return for the exposure of having the musicians pore over the list of prizes, with links back to the company's site for more info. (The power of drool.)  A little admin work to enter the prize info, make sure the winner gets it, and oversee the system to make sure it's not being gamed in some surprising way, and voilá!  Free song contest.
</p>

<h3>status: building</h3>

<h2>Schema</h2>
<p>
A (musician) person creates a <strong>song</strong>, with a title, artist, lyrics, and <strong>genre</strong>.  They probably upload the audio to <a href="http://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a>.
</p><p>
Then any (normal) person can create a <strong>vote</strong> for that song anonymously, (they can hear the song but don't know who it is until after they vote), which is a numeric rating with a comment and date.
</p><p>
The site manager is contacting companies to contribute prizes to the contest.  When one agrees, the manager creates a <strong>company</strong>, tied to a person_id, and at least one <strong>prize</strong>, with a name and description.
</p><p>
The musician who has added a song to the contest can browse through the prizes and add a <strong>wish</strong> for their song to win any number of available prizes for that contest.
</p><p>
At the end of the month, all votes are tallied to create a <strong>winner</strong>, which is really just a cached summary of that month's activity.
</p><p>
Then the manager goes through the winning songs to assign the prizes (based on the wishes, when possible), by updating that prize's song_id to match the winning song.
